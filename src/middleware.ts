export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Protect everything except the login/fill pages, public/auth APIs, the device-facing
    // analytics ingest endpoints, Next internals, and any static asset file (extension
    // match — covers /logo.jpg, /icon.png, /icons/*, favicon.ico, manifest.json, etc.) so
    // unauthenticated pages like /login can load images.
    //
    // ── Why the analytics/v1 entries are here ────────────────────────────────
    // These four are posted to by a Python agent on the store laptop. It has no browser, no
    // cookie and no user account; it authenticates with an `x-api-key` header that
    // src/lib/analytics/device-auth.ts checks inside the handler.
    //
    // Without these exclusions withAuth intercepts the agent before the handler ever runs,
    // and the failure is SILENT in the worst way: `requests` follows the redirect, fetches
    // /login, gets a perfectly good 200 HTML page, and the agent marks the batch delivered —
    // then purges it three days later. Counted customers vanish with no error anywhere, and
    // a dashboard reading low looks exactly like a quiet day in the shop.
    //
    // Each analytics path is listed in full ON PURPOSE. `api/v1` or `api/analytics` as a
    // prefix would work today and would silently make every future route beneath them
    // public — /api/analytics/dashboard is business data and must stay behind the session.
    //
    // ── External poller ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // `api/earn-sync` is called by an external poller. No user exists, so withAuth
    // redirected it to /login — including requests carrying the correct Bearer token,
    // because withAuth reads the session cookie and never looks at the Authorization
    // header. It is listed in CLAUDE.md under "routes that must stay public".
    //
    // A prefix is correct HERE, unlike above, because the whole directory has one purpose.
    // The contract that makes it safe: **every route beneath this prefix MUST check its own
    // shared key in the handler.** A new route added without that check is public to the
    // internet.
    //
    // `api/cron` and `api/services/cron` used to be listed here too. Both directories were
    // deleted when scheduled jobs were removed from this application — there are no crons,
    // and `CRON_SECRET` no longer exists. Ordinary authenticated routes behind
    // `requireFeature` (like Zoho pull and import routes) must NOT be excluded here.
    // Do not re-add a cron prefix: it would make every route beneath it public to the internet.
    // ── Customer-facing flows ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // `review` and `api/services/reviews` serve a customer who has no account: JobCard
    // builds `${origin}/review/${tokenNumber}` and sends it over WhatsApp. Without these
    // exclusions withAuth 307s the customer to /login and the page reports "Something went
    // wrong" — the HTML-with-status-200 trap described above, from the other direction.
    // Both are named in CLAUDE.md under "Routes that must stay public"; they were listed
    // there and never added here, so the link has never worked for a customer.
    //
    // `api/services/reviews` is listed IN FULL, not as the `api/services` prefix, for the
    // same reason the analytics paths are: a prefix would make every future workshop route
    // public. The route handler checks the token itself.
    //
    // `api/services/earn-sync` is the shared-key external poller (CLAUDE.md). Only the
    // sibling `api/earn-sync` was excluded, so the poller was being redirected to /login and
    // reading the login page as a successful empty response.
