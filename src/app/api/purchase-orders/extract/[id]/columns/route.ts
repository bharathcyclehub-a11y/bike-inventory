/**
 * The person has confirmed which column is what — extract the rows (plan 0909, §3.2 step 4).
 *
 * Body: `{ sheets: SheetColumnsConfirm[], rescue?: boolean }`. The normal path is
 * deterministic: `extractRows` reads every row below each sheet's header with the fill colour
 * of its item-name cell, no AI, no row cap. `rescue: true` is step 5 — the whole sheet goes to
 * the model and rows come back without colours; the review says so through `source: "ai"`.
 *
 * The workbook is read back from the file store: it is not kept in the database, and the
 * upload refused the sheet if storage was not configured. A file that has since gone (the
 * provider was switched, the object deleted) answers with a sentence asking for a fresh
 * upload — the extraction is scratch, re-uploading costs nothing.
 *
 * Reopening "Columns" on a review that already has rows is allowed: the rows are replaced,
 * every one unselected, in the same transaction that flips the stage. A person ticks rows
 * after seeing them, never before (every extracted row is `selected: false`).
 *
 * Owner-only — somebody else's extraction is a 404, so the id is not worth confirming.
