 * Email the purchase order to the vendor, with the PDF attached.
 *
 * ─── DELIVERY IS AT-LEAST-ONCE, AND THIS ROUTE SAYS SO ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Between Gmail accepting the message and this process recording that it did, there is a
 * window. A crash or a timeout in that window leaves a send that HAPPENED with a row that says
 * PENDING. Nothing can close that gap over SMTP; what can be done is make it small and make it
 * visible:
 *
 *   1. The `PurchaseOrderSend` row is written PENDING **before** the SMTP call, so a
 *      double-tap mid-flight is caught by the cooldown below rather than sending twice.
 *   2. The moment `sendMail` resolves, ONE narrow update stamps the messageId. The crash
 *      window is that single statement wide, not the whole transaction that follows.
 *   3. On entry, any PENDING row older than five minutes is marked FAILED with
 *      "unknown — timed out", so a stale row never blocks a retry or reads as in-flight.
 *
 * A row carrying a messageId whose purchase order never flipped is therefore "sent, not
 * confirmed" — and the vendor's own copy is the tiebreaker, which is why the PDF filename
 * carries the PO number and why `sendCount` increments.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS DOES NOT ASK canTransition ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A RESEND is legal from SENT_TO_VENDOR, and `PO_TRANSITIONS` has no self-edge there — asking
 * the table would refuse every resend with a 409. So the state check is explicit, and the
 * status flip is claimed only on the FIRST send, with `status: "APPROVED"` in the WHERE.
 * (Getting this wrong in the other direction is exactly what made mark-sent dead code in P9.)
