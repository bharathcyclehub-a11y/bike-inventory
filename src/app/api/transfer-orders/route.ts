/**
 * POST: raise a transfer order.
 *
 * ─── WHAT CHANGED IN P14, AND WHY EACH PIECE MOVED ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. THE LANE IS ON THE HEADER. See `createSchema`.
 *
 * 2. NO STOCK MOVES HERE. The old route auto-approved for anyone holding `transfers.approve`
 *    and then moved the stock in the same breath — source down, destination up, at CREATE
 *    time. Under P14, approval agrees to a movement and dispatch performs it, because between
 *    two buildings there is a van and the units are in neither for an hour. Auto-approve still
 *    happens; it just lands in APPROVED with nothing moved.
 *
 * 3. THE ORDER NUMBER COMES FROM `nextSequence`, INSIDE THE TRANSACTION. It was a
 *    read-then-write ordered by `orderNo` as a STRING, running BEFORE the transaction opened —
 *    both halves of the bug P9 fixed for purchase orders. Two people pressing Create at the
 *    same moment both read TRF-202609-0006 and both tried to write 0007; `orderNo` is unique,
 *    so one of them lost their work to a raw P2002. And "TRF-202609-0002" sorts above
 *    "TRF-202609-00010", so past nine-hundred-odd transfers in a month it would have started
 *    handing out numbers that already existed.
 *
 * 4. THE DOCUMENT IS CHOSEN BY THE MODE AND ATTACHED HERE. Store → Store carries a tax invoice,
 *    Store → Warehouse a delivery challan (`docTypeForMode`), and the file is required in the
 *    create body. The stores' GSTINs are NOT consulted — the rule that refused a transfer while
 *    a GSTIN was blank (`deriveTransferPolicy`) was deleted on the owner's instruction,
 *    9 Sep 2026. `requiredDocType` is still written, because the dispatch gate, the detail
 *    chip and the document card all read it.
 *
 * 5. A STORE IS PICKED, A WAREHOUSE IS STORED. Stock lives in warehouses, so the store on the
 *    form resolves to its floor (`resolveStoreWarehouse`) and the lane columns hold warehouse
 *    ids as before. `fromStoreId`/`toStoreId` are kept as a snapshot of what was chosen, so a
 *    store whose floor is re-pointed later still reads correctly in history.
