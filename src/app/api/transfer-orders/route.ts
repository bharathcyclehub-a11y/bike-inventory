 * dispatch route refuses without it and `documentSatisfied` hides the button. The number and
 * date stay optional either way. The file has already been PUT to storage by the browser under

/**
 * POST: raise a transfer order.
 *
 * ─── WHAT CHANGED IN P14, AND WHY EACH PIECE MOVED ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. THE LANE IS ON THE HEADER. See `createSchema`.
 *
 * 2. NO STOCK MOVES HERE. The old route auto-approved for anyone holding `transfers.approve`
 *    and then moved the stock in the same breath — source down, destination up, at CREATE
 *    time. Under P14, approval agrees to a movement and dispatch performs it, because between
 *    two buildings there is a van and the units are in neither for an hour. Auto-approve still
 *    happens; it just lands in APPROVED with nothing moved.
 *
 * 3. THE ORDER NUMBER COMES FROM `nextSequence`, INSIDE THE TRANSACTION. It was a
 *    read-then-write ordered by `orderNo` as a STRING, running BEFORE the transaction opened —
 *    both halves of the bug P9 fixed for purchase orders. Two people pressing Create at the
 *    same moment both read TRF-202609-0006 and both tried to write 0007; `orderNo` is unique,
 *    so one of them lost their work to a raw P2002. And "TRF-202609-0002" sorts above
 *    "TRF-202609-00010", so past nine-hundred-odd transfers in a month it would have started
 *    handing out numbers that already existed.
 *
 * 4. THE DOCUMENT IS CHOSEN BY THE TWO STORES AND ATTACHED HERE (plan 0310, Q7). Between two
 *    different stores a tax invoice travels, inside one store a delivery challan
 *    (`docTypeForLane`). The stores' GSTINs are NOT consulted — the rule that refused a transfer
 *    while a GSTIN was blank (`deriveTransferPolicy`) was deleted on the owner's instruction,
 *    9 Sep 2026. `requiredDocType` is still written, because the dispatch gate, the detail
 *    chip and the document card all read it.
 *
 * 5. TWO WAREHOUSES ARE PICKED (plan 0310, Part D). `fromStoreId`/`toStoreId` are written from
 *    the warehouses' stores, both always, as a snapshot — a warehouse moved to another store
 *    later still reads correctly in history.
