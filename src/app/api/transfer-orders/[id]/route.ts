/**
 * GET: one transfer, everything the detail screen needs, in one request.
 *
 * ─── MONEY IS GATED, AND THE GATE IS COARSER THAN IT LOOKS ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `unitCost` and `consignmentValue` are returned only with `cost_price.view`. The consignment
 * value is gated for a reason that is easy to miss: on a small transfer it is trivially
 * invertible. One line of twelve units at a total of ₹9,600 tells anybody who can do division
 * exactly what the shop pays per unit — so shipping the total to everyone would leak the cost
 * price that the `cost_price` module exists to protect.
 *
 * Everyone else gets `eWayBillRequired: boolean` instead: the operational fact they actually
 * need ("this consignment needs a bill") without the number behind it.
 *
 * ─── THE ACTION LIST IS COMPUTED HERE, NOT IN THE BROWSER ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The screen renders whatever `actions[]` contains and derives nothing from role names. The
 * routes re-check regardless — a client is never the gate — but this keeps the buttons and the
 * permissions from drifting apart, which is exactly how the purchase-order module ended up
 * with three disagreeing opinions about who could do what.
 *
 * ─── WHY THE ACTOR NAMES NEED A SECOND QUERY ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `dispatchedById`, `receivedById` and `docUploadedById` are bare `String?` columns with NO
 * relation and no foreign key — unlike `createdById` and `reviewedById`, which are proper
 * relations. So Prisma cannot `include` them, and the timeline resolves the three ids with one
 * `findMany` rather than dragging a fourth migration into this phase to add the constraints.

/**
 * PATCH: fix a RETURNED transfer and leave it ready to resubmit (R25, Q36).
 *
 * ─── WHY THERE WAS NO EDIT ROUTE BEFORE, AND WHY THIS ONE IS SAFE ─────────────────────────
 *
 * A transfer order has never been editable after create. That was right while Reject was
 * terminal: the only way back was a NEW order, and an order whose lines could change under an
 * approver would make approval meaningless. R25 replaces Reject with RETURNED — the creator
 * fixes the SAME record — so exactly one status accepts an edit, and it is the one status in
 * which nobody has agreed to anything and no stock has moved.
 *
 * `status: "RETURNED"` is therefore in the WHERE of every write below, not only in an `if`
 * above them. An order approved a moment ago by somebody else cannot have its lines rewritten
 * by a PATCH that read the row a second earlier.
 *
 * The lines are REPLACED, not merged. A returned order is being re-stated, and merging would
 * leave a line the creator deleted on a record they believe they corrected. The same four
 * checks `POST /api/transfer-orders` applies run first (`src/lib/transfers/items.ts`).
 *
 * The lane (`mode`, the two warehouses, `requiredDocType`) is NOT editable. Changing it would
 * change which document the transfer needs and which building the stock leaves, which is a
 * different transfer — cancel this one and raise that.
