/**
 * Move every product out of one category into another, then delete the source.
 *
 * This is the operation that actually repairs the taxonomy. The categories in this database
 * came from Zoho's `category_name` verbatim, so several of them are wheel sizes (`16`,
 * `24 SS`, `29 MS`) and 151 products sit in `Uncategorized`. Renaming does not help — the
 * useful action is "everything in `16` belongs in Bicycles, and `16` should stop existing".
 *
 * Guarded on `categories.create` rather than `edit`, matching api/brands/[id]/merge: the
 * caller is choosing a destination and destroying a row, which is more than an edit.
