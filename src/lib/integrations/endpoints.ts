// ─── The endpoint registry ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every Zoho endpoint this application touches, in one place, with the client method that
// owns it.
//
// It exists because that list was previously unanswerable. `src/lib/integrations/` was
// already a real client layer — OAuth, refresh, 401-retry-once, 429 backoff, pagination —
// but nothing anywhere said WHICH endpoints the app depends on, so "what breaks if Zoho
// changes X" could only be answered by grepping for backtick-quoted paths across four files.
//
// This is a DESCRIPTION, not a router. Nothing dispatches through it: the client methods
// still build their own URLs, because a query string assembled from optional arguments is
// clearer written out than expressed as a template. The registry's jobs are narrower:
//
//   1. `apiCall` takes an optional endpoint key and logs it, so a debug line reads
//      `endpoint: "bills.list"` instead of an interpolated URL with a date range in it.
//   2. `docs/integrations-endpoints.md` is generated from it, so the documentation cannot
//      drift from the code the way prose would.
//
// Adding a Zoho call means adding a client method AND an entry here. A call made from
// outside `src/lib/integrations/` is a bug — after the escape hatches were closed, `apiCall`
// is `protected`, so the compiler enforces that rather than a review convention.
