// ─── Server-side RBAC resolver ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// The single source of truth for "what can this user do". Every answer comes from the
// database (modules / permissions / roles / role_permissions) — nothing is hardcoded here,
// so an admin changing a grant takes effect on the very next request with no redeploy.
//
// Replaces the former src/lib/permissions-server.ts, which held per-role permission maps
// in code and merged them with two JSON blobs (User.permissions, AlertConfig.rolePermissions).
// Those are all gone.
//
// Request-level memoisation
// -------------------------
// React's cache() dedupes by argument within a single server request. A route handler that
// checks two permissions therefore hits the database once, not twice, while two different
// requests never share a result. That is deliberate: a cross-request cache would keep a
// revoked permission alive, which is the bug this whole migration exists to remove.
