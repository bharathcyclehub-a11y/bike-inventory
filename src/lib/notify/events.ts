// ─── The event registry ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ONLY place an event key is defined. Every `notify()` call, every row in
// NotificationEventSetting, every checkbox on the settings screen and every row on the /more
// preferences section keys off this object. Add an event here, and the rest of the system
// picks it up; add a string literal anywhere else and it is a bug.
//
// Plan: docs/implementation/pending/notifications-and-settings-rbac-plan.md, Part F.
//
// `defaults` is what applies when NotificationEventSetting has NO row for the key — the
// column defaults on that table are deliberately not the whole story, because the right
// default differs per event (zoho.pull_finished is the one that mails by default: it is the
// event most likely to report something already broken while nobody is watching).
//
// Email defaults off nearly everywhere because it is the scarce channel: a free Gmail account
// sends ~500/day, and one event to 40 staff is 8% of that. Push is free.
