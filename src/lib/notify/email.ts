// ─── Email sender — SMTP via nodemailer ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ONLY code in the repo that puts a message on an SMTP socket. It exists for ONE job:
// emailing purchase orders to vendors (POST /api/purchase-orders/[id]/send), plus the admin's
// test send. It is never a staff notification channel — notify() is push only since 23 Sep
// 2026 (plan 2309). Nothing else should import nodemailer. Every shape here comes from ./types — the contract the notify modules and the
// routes are written against — so this file can change internally without anything else
// noticing.
//
// Plan: docs/implementation/pending/notifications-and-settings-rbac-plan.md, Part C.
//
// WHAT THE OWNER HAS TO DO IN GOOGLE (plan §C.1 — no Google Cloud project needed)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The sending account is a Gmail address, and Gmail will not take the account password over
// SMTP. It wants an App Password, and App Passwords do not exist until 2-Step Verification
// is on:
//
//   1. Google Account → Security → turn on 2-Step Verification.
//   2. Google Account → Security → App Passwords → generate → copy the 16-character value.
//   3. /settings/notifications → Email: host smtp.gmail.com, port 587, secure OFF (STARTTLS),
//      user = the full address, password = the App Password. Press "Send test email".
//      `emailConnected` flips true only when Gmail answers a real 250 — saving never sets it.
//
// THE LIMIT THAT WILL ACTUALLY BITE (plan §C.2)
// --------------------------------------------
// A free @gmail.com account may send to roughly 500 recipients a day (Google Workspace:
// ~2,000), and `From` is locked to the account or a verified alias. One event mailed to 40
// staff is 8% of a day's quota. That is why email defaults OFF per event in events.ts while
// push defaults on, and why every recipient has a personal opt-in — email is the scarce
// channel; push is free. If this ever mails customers rather than staff, SMTP is the wrong
// tool, and the `emailProvider` column exists so a transactional service can take over
// without touching a call site. Gmail OAuth was weighed and rejected for a free account —
// read §C.3 before proposing it again.
//
// THREE RULES THIS FILE ENFORCES
// ------------------------------
// - The transport is built PER CALL and never cached in module scope. On Vercel a module
//   lives as long as the lambda instance does, so a cached transport would keep mailing
//   through credentials an admin revoked minutes ago. Re-reading NotificationConfig costs
//   one primary-key read; being wrong costs mail sent with a dead password.
// - The App Password never leaves this module: not in a log line, not in a thrown error,
//   not in SendResult.error. nodemailer's SMTPError carries the provoking `command`, which
//   for AUTH PLAIN / AUTH LOGIN is the credentials in base64 — so every string we let out is
//   scrubbed of the password in raw AND base64 form first (see scrub()).
// - "Not configured" is a THROW (NotConfiguredError); "the send failed" is a RESULT
//   ({ ok: false }). The PO send route and the test route show the message as-is, and the
//   PO screen uses checkEmailReady() to say plainly that SMTP is not set up. Blurring the two
//   would hide a misconfiguration behind a generic failure.
//
// Routes that call this must declare `export const runtime = "nodejs"`. SMTP is a raw TCP
// socket on 587/465, the Edge runtime cannot open one, and the failure it produces does not
// say so — which is why the rule is repeated here and not only in the plan.
