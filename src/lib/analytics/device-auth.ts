//

// ("analytics"), used by the dashboard route instead.
//
// The pilot's own auth carried two findings that this port preserves (findings-2026-08-01):
//
//   C2  `if (!key) return true` — a forgotten environment variable silently DISABLED
//       authentication instead of failing closed. The rule here is absolute:
//       **a missing or unknown credential denies. It never permits.**
//
//   DAT-002  the store is derived from the KEY, never from the request body. A store-1
//       device used to be able to write rows into store-9 simply by asking. Callers get
//       `storeId` back from this module and must ignore any `store_id` in the payload.
//
// What changed from the pilot: keys lived in a STORE_KEYS environment JSON, compared in a
// timing-safe loop over every configured key. They now live in the analytics_devices table,
// stored as a sha-256 hash. That makes rotation a database write instead of a redeploy, and
// it means a database leak does not hand anyone the ability to forge footfall. The timing-safe
// loop is gone with it — lookup is a single indexed match on the hash, and the hash of an
// unknown key reveals nothing about any real one.

import { createHash, randomBytes } from "crypto";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db";
// storeId is a Store.id now, not an enum member. DAT-002 is unchanged and unchanged in
// importance: this value comes from the KEY, never from the request body.
