/**
 * Create a purchase order. THE only way one gets created.
 *
 * ─── WHY THERE IS ONE OF THESE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There were two independent creators, and they disagreed about nearly everything:
 * `api/purchase-orders/route.ts` padded the number to five digits and ordered by `createdAt`;
 * the brand-stock `generate-po` route (deleted 9 Sep 2026 — its job is now the quotation
 * import on /purchase-orders/new, which creates through this function) padded to four and
 * ordered by `poNumber` as a STRING, which is not merely racy — once `PO-00010` exists it
 * sorts below `PO-0002`, so that route read the wrong "last" PO and emitted a number already
 * taken.
 *
 * That second route never worked at all. It passed `hsnCode` into a `PurchaseOrderItem` create
 * and that column does not exist, so every valid request threw
 * `PrismaClientValidationError: Unknown argument 'hsnCode'` and returned a 500. It survived
 * because the object came out of a `.map()` rather than a fresh literal, so TypeScript's
 * excess-property check never fired: clean tsc, clean build, guaranteed runtime failure.
 * Routing it through here fixes it by construction — this function never builds that field.
 *
 * ─── THE LOCK, AND THE REASON THAT ACTUALLY APPLIES ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock` — the TRANSACTION-scoped variant. The session-scoped
 * `pg_advisory_lock` would be wrong here, and NOT primarily because of pgbouncer:
 *
 *   `src/lib/db.ts` creates a bare `new PrismaClient()`, so the query engine keeps its own
 *   connection pool. A session lock binds to whichever pooled connection served the statement
 *   and is returned to the pool still held; a later unlock is not guaranteed to land on the
 *   same connection, and any throw between lock and unlock leaks it until the process exits.
 *
 * That is true on `localhost:5432` — which is what `.env` points at today and what anyone
 * building this will test against. It is ALSO true, for a second and independent reason, on
 * the 6543 `pgbouncer=true` pooler used in production, where the connection is pinned only for
 * the duration of the transaction. The transaction-scoped lock is released by COMMIT/ROLLBACK
 * inside the engine, which holds on every topology this repo has used.
 *
 * So: do not "simplify" this to `pg_advisory_lock`. It would appear to work in dev and leak.
 *
 * `$executeRaw`, not `$queryRaw`: the function returns `void`, and nothing in this codebase
 * has ever deserialised a void return.
 *
 * The `::int4` on the namespace is not decoration. Prisma binds a JS number as BIGINT, so the
 * uncast call asks Postgres for `pg_advisory_xact_lock(bigint, integer)`, which does not exist:
 * 42883, on every single purchase order. `hashtext` already returns int4, so the second
 * argument needs nothing. This was found by running the statement, not by reading about it —
 * reasoning about the SQL literal misses what the parameter binder does to it.
 *
 * `hashtext` can collide across vendor ids (int4 key space). A collision serialises two
 * unrelated vendors against each other. That over-serialises; it cannot corrupt.
 *
 * ─── ONE KNOWN DEGRADATION, so it is not a surprise later ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `prisma migrate deploy` runs from the Vercel build against live traffic. An
 * `ALTER TABLE "PurchaseOrder"` takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE; a PO creation blocked behind it now
 * holds the vendor lock while it waits, so every other create for that vendor queues behind it
 * and they hit the 15 s timeout as P2028. Before this they would have failed independently.
