//
// A call site builds an AiRequest and gets back an AiResult. It never names a provider, a
// model or an API key — those come from the active AiProvider row. An adapter turns an
// AiRequest plus {apiKey, model} into an AiCompletion using its provider's official SDK,
// and reports failure by throwing AiError with a `kind` the resolver can act on (retry, or
// surface with a message that says what to do).
