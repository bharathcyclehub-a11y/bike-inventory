/**
 * The activity log writer (R11).
 *
 * ─── THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * How this behaves on failure depends on WHICH client you hand it, and that is the whole
 * design:
 *
 *   logActivity(tx, …)      inside a transaction — the log row is PART of the change.
 *                           A failed insert fails the business action. Use this whenever the
 *                           log is evidence: an approval, a dispatch, a stock movement.
 *
 *   logActivity(prisma, …)  on the root client — best effort. It NEVER throws, because a
 *                           full log table must not stop a person receiving a shipment.
 *                           A failure is recorded with log.error and the identifiers needed
 *                           to reconstruct the entry by hand.
 *
 * Detected by `"$transaction" in db`: the root `PrismaClient` has that method, a
 * `Prisma.TransactionClient` does not. That is a structural check rather than a flag the
 * caller can get wrong, which matters — passing `prisma` where you meant `tx` would silently
 * downgrade an audit trail to best-effort, and no type error would tell you.
 *
 * ─── WHY THE USER IS DENORMALISED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `userId`/`userName` are plain columns with no foreign key (see the model comment). Pass the
 * name you already have from the session; do not look it up. A log entry outlives the user it
 * names, and "by Ravi" must still read correctly after Ravi is deleted.
