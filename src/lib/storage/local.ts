// Server filesystem provider.
//
// Intended for a VPS or a container with a mounted volume. It is NOT usable on Vercel,
// where the filesystem is read-only apart from /tmp and /tmp is wiped between invocations —
// an uploaded photo would vanish before anyone could view it. `probeWritable()` exists so
// that failure is loud at configuration time instead of silent at upload time.
//
// Keys are stored with the same shape they would have in a bucket ("vendor-issues/x.webp"),
// so moving to S3 later is a file copy with no key rewriting and no URL surgery.
