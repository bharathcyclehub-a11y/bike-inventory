// Workshop-specific Zoho Books queries.

// TRANSPORT LIVES IN `@/lib/integrations` — this file owns only the queries that are
// peculiar to the workshop (invoice-number format guessing).
//
// It used to carry its own OAuth client: a module-scoped token cache, a hardcoded
// `https://accounts.zoho.in/oauth/v2/token`, and credentials read from ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN /
// ZOHO_CLIENT_ID / ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET / ZOHO_ORG_ID. That made it a FOURTH Zoho client
// alongside the three the integration refactor consolidated, and — worse — a second source
// of truth: disconnecting Zoho Books in Settings did not disconnect it here, because this
// file never read `IntegrationConfig`.
//
// Everything now goes through `getBooks()`, so one connection serves the whole app and
// `res.json()` on a third-party response is gone (apiCall uses readJson, which names the
// service and status instead of failing with `Unexpected token '<'`).
