/**
 * The two names the Zoho import INVENTS.
 *
 * `Product.brandId` and `Product.categoryId` are non-null (`schema.prisma:449,451`), so an
 * import with no brand and no category cannot record "unknown" — it has to write something.
 * It writes these. They are not facts about the product; they are the absence of a fact,
 * wearing a name, and the /stock card used to render `Imported` in exactly the same blue as
 * a real brand like `Atlas`.
 *
 * They live here rather than as literals because five import sites spelled them
 * independently, and every screen that wants to say "this one still needs a person" has to
 * compare against the same spelling. One drifted literal and the "Needs details" filter
 * silently returns nothing — a filter that finds nothing looks exactly like a catalog with
 * no problems.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: imported by both API routes and client components, so it
 * must not pull in prisma or anything server-only. Same rule as `inventory-config.ts`.
 *
 * The root cause is that `Product.brandId` and `Product.categoryId` are non-null on a model
 * where both facts are routinely unknown, so an import cannot record absence and has to write
 * something. Making them nullable is a schema change touching every screen that assumes a
 * brand and a category exist, and it is deliberately not done here. Until it is, these are
 * the marker.

 *
 *   Once, every product the catalog import created was `Uncategorized`, so this fired on the
 *   whole catalog. A signal that fires always is not a signal, and both the "Needs details"
 *   filter and the /stock card stopped testing it.
 *
 *   The catalog import now writes the product's REAL Zoho category, and only 665 of 5,738
 *   products land on the placeholder. It is the exception again, so the /stock card tests it
 *   once more and renders it muted — the same treatment a placeholder brand gets.
 *
 * Still NOT part of the "Needs details" filter (`api/products/route.ts`), which matches on
 * brand only. Display and filter therefore disagree about category on purpose: a muted
 * category tells a person to look, it does not put the row in the fix-up queue. If that queue
 * is ever widened to include category, change both together — a card that flags a row the
 * filter passes by is the same failure, in the other direction.
