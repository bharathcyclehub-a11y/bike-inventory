# Implementation plans

Plan documents, filed by whether the work is done.

```
docs/implementation/
  ├── pending/     approved or proposed, not finished
  └── completed/   shipped and verified
```

Reference documents that are not implementation plans stay at `docs/` root:
`data-flow-and-modules.md`, `schema-review.md`, `ai-usage-audit.md`,
`ledger-and-reconciliation-flow.md`, `brand-ledger-flow.md`, and the `agents/` board.
(`dead-code.md`, `phase2-architecture.md`, `water-flow-chart.md` and
`bank-statement-upload-flow.md` were deleted on 16 Sep 2026 — recover them from `fe50ca2`
if they are wanted back.)

A **requirements document** — the ask and its open questions, written before any plan
exists — is not a plan and does not belong in `pending/`, where the status-line rules and
the `*-plan.md` hooks would apply to it. Those live in `docs/implementation/requiremnts/`.
The deliveries module keeps its own notes and captured API responses in `docs/deliveries/`.

---

## The status line — required, and machine-read

Every plan **must** carry a status line in its first 15 lines. The first word after
`Status:` must be exactly one of three tokens. Anything after an em-dash is free text.

```
Status: pending
Status: in-progress
Status: completed — 28 Aug 2026, storage provider is switchable from Settings
```

The token is strict because it is parsed. Before it existed, plans wrote their status as
prose — *"PLAN ONLY — not implemented"*, *"plan, plus the RBAC groundwork already seeded"* —
which no script can classify, and which drifted out of date without anyone noticing. Two
files sat in `completed/` still claiming they were not implemented.

## The branch line — required, directly under the status

Every plan **must** name its branch, on the line after `Status:`:

```
Branch: **`refactor/zoho-endpoint-registry`** — create it with exactly this name, off `main`.
Branch: **`perf/single-auth-query-v2`** — implemented here.
```

One line, one branch name, and the name written here is the name to create. It answers two
questions the file previously could not: *where do I run this?* before the work, and *where
did this ship?* afterwards. If the work lands somewhere else, correct the line rather than
leaving it describing the intent.

Do not bury the branch in prose halfway down the document — this line is where the next
person looks.

## The requirement comes first — required section order

Owner's instruction, 8 Sep 2026: a plan is not an implementation note with a requirement
pasted somewhere in it. Every plan written from that date opens with what was asked, then
what was unclear about it, and only then how it will be built. In this order:

| § | Section | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Requirement** | the owner's words **verbatim**, then restated as numbered `R1…Rn` |
| 1 | **Questions and clarifications** | a table — question, *why it changes the build*, options, recommended default, **answer**. Answers are dated as they arrive in a "Decisions on record" sub-table. A question whose answer changes the build blocks the build until answered |
| 2 | **How it works today** | verified against the code, every claim with `file:line` |
| 3 | **Implementation plan** | files, phases, dependencies, migration, RBAC, logging, the board-of-agents check |
| 4 | **Verification** | what to run and what to see |
| 5 | **Out of scope** | what was deliberately left alone, so the next reader does not "finish" it |

`0809-brand-category-inactive-and-audit-approval-plan.md` is the first plan in this shape;
copy its headings.

## How a plan moves

**Normal path — run `/ship-plan <file>`.** It sets the status to `completed`, moves the
file, refreshes the tables below, and stages the result.

**Safety net — a `PostToolUse` hook.** If you edit a plan in `pending/` and change its
status line to `completed`, `.claude/hooks/plan-status.cjs` moves the file for you and
refreshes the tables. The move is announced, never silent.

**Placement is enforced.** A `PreToolUse` hook blocks writing a `*-plan.md` anywhere under
`docs/` except `docs/implementation/`. Prevention rather than tidying up afterwards.

**The requirement-first order is enforced too.** The same hook
(`.claude/hooks/plan-placement.cjs`) blocks writing a **new** plan whose first `##` section
is not the requirement, or whose opening section lists nothing — no `R1…Rn` and no numbered
list. The list may be `R1…Rn` or a plain numbered reading of the ask; the point is that a
later reader can check the build against the requirements one by one.

Only new files are checked. Editing a plan that already exists is never blocked, or every
plan written before 8 Sep 2026 would become unwritable.

Regenerate the tables by hand at any time:

```
node .claude/hooks/plan-status.cjs --sync
```

## Current contents

The two tables below are generated from disk. Edit the descriptions freely — they are
preserved across regeneration — but do not remove the marker comments.

<!-- BEGIN:completed -->
| Plan | Shipped |
|---|---|
| `0409-unified-purchasing-transfers-cleanup-plan.md` | **SHIPPED and MERGED — every phase P0–P15 built except P11, which the owner dropped** — R1–R13 closed (R9 by P12). **Verified 9 Sep 2026 against the code and against git**: all ten phase commits are ancestors of `main` and `git rev-list --count main..feat/purchasing-transfers-p5-p15` is 0, so the plan's old "nothing merged" line was stale. Two of its rules have since been superseded and are recorded at the top of the plan: R13/O11 (the Vercel build stopped running `migrate deploy` on 7 Sep) and §5.1 (a whole-store audit no longer 400s; from 8 Sep the approver names the receiving warehouse). **P14/P15 found and fixed a pre-existing P9 bug: `Prisma.sql` cooks `'D'` to `'D'`, so `poSeedSql` threw 22P02 and every purchase order would have 500’d once one PO row existed** — all five seed queries corrected. **P11 and its requirement R7 — the colour-coded availability sheet — were DROPPED by the owner on 6 Sep 2026** because the implementation needs to change; nothing depended on P11, so it blocks nothing. `tsc` and `eslint` green, `npm run build` passes; **no phase has been browser-walked** — that is the one outstanding check on all nine. **Branching (owner, 5–6 Sep): P0–P7 each had a branch; P5 and P8–P15 share `feat/purchasing-transfers-p5-p15`, one commit per phase** — see the plan's §3. **Replaces** `0409-purchasing-deliveries-transfers-plan.md` and `stock-audit-inbound-zoho-window-and-cleanup-plan.md` (both deleted 4 Sep 2026, merged by a three-agent reconciliation). **17 phases P0–P15**, bugs first: P4 `/deliveries` Zoho fetch (disconnected Zoho reported as success, a `SyncLog` row that blocks retries for 2 min, a client path with no `else`, UTC dates; one merged `trigger-pull` spec and one `skipped` shape for both plans), P6 stock audit scope by store/warehouse, P7 per-line inbound receiving + Report Issue; then the removals (ProductType, `movingLevel`, manual customers), the activity log, `/stock` one-tap reorder, PO vendor derived from `reorderVendorId` → `BrandVendor.isPrimary`, duplicate-PO 409 + state machine + `Counter`, brand-sheet fill colours via `exceljs` (no AI), real vendor email with a server-side jspdf PDF (no API key), and transfers last (floor + godown per store, `Store.gstin`, derived TAX_INVOICE vs DELIVERY_CHALLAN, IN_TRANSIT/RECEIVED). **Three migration folders applied by the Vercel build** (owner answered 4 Sep: `main` auto-deploys, so P1 wires `migrate deploy` into the build; MIG-1a additive at P1, MIG-1b drops at P3, MIG-2 transfer backfill at P14; snapshot before each). Owner decisions D1–D9 and O1–O7 recorded; **§10 lists 13 blockers and 8 owner questions with a recommendation each** — the first four (`.env` points at the Supabase pooler, a dirty working tree, which project is production, no migrate step in the Vercel build) are half a day of the owner's time and gate everything except P2. **Reviewed 4 Sep against the code** (clarify-plan, ~220 claims, three sweeps + schema review): 14 citations corrected, one blocker (BL13) withdrawn, 13 build-changing corrections applied — atomic `Counter`, one PO creator with advisory-lock timeouts, no ₹0 POs, narrow reorder route, floor rows filtered from receiving, `consignmentValue` gated, at-least-once send semantics, and the live "sales are erased by the next warehouse write" defect promoted to a named risk. Q1, Q2, Q8, Q9 answered 4 Sep (import + tag BCC invoices; BCH buys for both; migrate in the build; receive to floor or godown by choice); Q3–Q7, Q10, Q11 run on stated defaults |
| `0709-bottom-nav-per-user-tabs-plan.md` | 8 Sep 2026, the pinned tabs reach the phone: one `MAX_NAV_TABS` cap, `navTabs` carried through `rbac` → `/api/my-permissions` → the client store, the bar hidden outright when nothing is pinned, and a header drawer as the safety net. |
| `0709-zoho-brand-category-sync-plan.md` | 8 Sep 2026, the Zoho brand and category masters reach the app by id: `zohoBrandId` / `zohoCategoryId`, `listAllBrands` / `listAllCategories`, a preview + import route pair on each side, and one `ZohoTaxonomySheet` on `/more/brands` and `/categories`. The bill import and the stock count stopped inventing brands. |
| `0809-ai-provider-settings-and-shared-client-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026, on `main` (`c8f1b61`), all five phases: the provider table and migration `20260908143858_ai_provider`, the model catalogue in code, `src/lib/ai/` with three adapters behind one client, the four existing call sites migrated onto it, and `/api/settings/ai` with its activate and test routes. **Which provider is live is data now, not an env var.** Supersedes Phases 0-3 of `ai-provider-config-and-task-routing-plan.md`, which is still pending and needs its sections 4, 6 and 11 amended to say so. **Still owed:** `npx prisma migrate deploy` anywhere but the local database - the migration has only ever been applied locally. |
| `0809-brand-category-inactive-and-audit-approval-plan.md` | **SHIPPED — built and committed 8 Sep 2026 as `ddf0092` on `feat/taxonomy-inactive-and-audit-approval` (30 files, +2224/−565), the single end-of-work commit §1.1 ordered; the first plan in the requirement-first shape. Every §3 artefact re-verified against the code on disk 9 Sep 2026, item by item. `npm run build` and the §4 browser pass are the owner's, not yet run; `db:seed:rbac` and `migrate deploy` on the target still owed (§6) — until the re-seed, `/team/permissions` still shows a Delete checkbox that grants nothing. Not yet merged to `main`. One gap the plan never enumerated, so out of its scope and still open: `stock-audit/new/page.tsx:249` still tells the person creating a whole-store audit "Verify only — to correct stock, audit one warehouse", which this plan made false.** Three parts, one commit each: **A** `Brand.isActive` / `Category.isActive` (one additive migration), both DELETE routes and the `delete` action gone, deactivate cascades to products (and a category's subtree) in one transaction, `GET /api/brands` and `/api/categories` default to active-only so every picker follows for free; **B** `POST /api/stock-counts/[id]/zero-uncounted` — the dead baseline bulk-zero resurrected as a named, status-gated, idempotent action behind a button on the Uncounted tab — and the `+ Add new brand…` option removed from the count screen; **C** the review table becomes the one approval screen, with a per-line Now column, a two-way choice (record differences / set system stock) and a confirm sheet. **Found four live defects on the way:** a counted **0 is never applied** (`[id]/route.ts:270`, `!0` is true), the ledger row records the snapshot rather than live stock, the count-save route has no status check, and brand merge drops SetNull relations. **13 questions in §1**, each with a recommended default; Q9 (per-warehouse vs whole-store audits) decides whether R6 is even possible without a new rule. |
| `0809-brand-category-single-creation-path-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026, a brand or category is created by **one** path and nothing else: `brands.fetch` / `categories.fetch` in the catalog, the four `zoho-preview` / `zoho-import` routes, one shared `ZohoTaxonomySheet` on `/more/brands` and `/categories`, and the side-effect writers are closed - the bill approve route resolves the vendor name against the brand list and files a miss under `Unbranded` in a new `notices` list instead of inventing a row, the second brand lookup is gone, categories resolve by `zohoCategoryId` then name (which also fixed the case-sensitivity defect that failed a whole bill), and a stock count matches a suggested brand or reports it rather than creating it. `POST /api/brands` keeps its plain CRUD create, called deliberate by the plan. **Still owed:** `npm run db:seed:rbac` wherever this deploys, and the walk in its verification section (steps 3-9). |
| `0809-remove-per-item-and-by-brand-views-plan.md` | 8 Sep 2026, Per Item, the By Brand screen and the view-tab bar are gone; the product list is untouched and keeps a single By Location link. |
| `0809-stale-architect-doc-and-brand-clash-check-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026, both findings closed on `main` (`b158aa3`). Finding 2 route code shipped inside `ddf0092`; the blocker - `prisma/migrations/20260908151058_brand_name_ci_unique/` untracked while the *later* `20260908161249` was committed, so a fresh clone got the `isActive` columns and never the case-insensitive index - is gone, the folder is in git and the history is in order again. The architect doc no longer describes a constraint the database does not have. |
| `0809-vendor-opening-balance-on-listing-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026, on `main` (`5dcbdb3`): `openingBalance` is in the list route select (`api/vendors/route.ts:35`) and renders on `/vendors` in both the table and the card, blank at zero. `outstandingBalance` is a different number - computed from non-PAID bills, and what the sorts key on - and was left untouched. |
| `0909-expense-multi-entry-flow-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026 — expenses entered a step at a time, several to one atomic submit; payer stamped server-side; one receipt photo, deleted with the row; Expenses back in the sidebar (`89d9025`) |
| `0909-po-ai-upload-and-brand-stock-removal-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026 — quotation import on /purchase-orders/new and /brand-stock removed (`ee72cd5`); superseded the same day by the sheet-extraction plan (name-only lines); P5 drop migration left for a later release |
| `0909-po-sheet-ai-extraction-and-catalogue-free-lines-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026 — a PO from the vendor sheet alone: AI names the header and columns, code reads every row with its colour, a searchable colour-tinted review, lines carry the item name only, Download PDF (`76c12ef`); the §7 walk and the Reorder→PO decision are the owner's |
| `0909-stock-screens-size-category-and-sidebar-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026 — searchable Category/Brand filters, `size` out of every read and write (column drop next release), category picker on product edit, brand-count store step, inbound times, Warehouses unlinked from the sidebar (`c2c6913`) |
| `0909-stock-store-and-warehouse-scoping-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026 — `Warehouse.kind` FLOOR/GODOWN with seeded floors, floor-first outbound with a godown warning, By Store screen, store-scoped /stock filter (`c2c6913`, migration `warehouse_kind`) |
| `0909-transfer-mode-and-document-attachment-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026 — Store → Store / Store → Warehouse modes, the document required at creation and uploaded first, GSTIN never consulted and off the store form (`e846872`, migration `transfer_mode_and_store_lane`); godown→floor mode (Q12) left for the owner |
| `0909-vendor-ledger-screens-and-ai-import-plan.md` | 9 Sep 2026, Parts A–F shipped as `55acd4f`, which is an ancestor of `feat/remove-static-team-health`. **Owed:** the owner's `npm run build` and the browser pass — `docs/manual-testing/0909-vendor-ledger-verification.md` (13 sections, 84 cases); §6 of the plan is the build record. The API side was verified against local `bch` by curl the same day: migration `20260909162948_vendor_ledger_profile_uploads` additive and applied locally only, `db:seed:rbac` leaves ADMIN at 174/174 with both ledger modules unassignable, the aoki and lucifer imports tie the app's closing figures to the rupee (₹5,12,960 and ₹18,48,717), a CSV statement runs to a tie-out with no AI, delete-from-storage and the evidence upload work; the one AI call reached Anthropic and was refused for **no credit** — the provider, not the code. Two bugs found and fixed on the way (a date regex missing its backslashes; the sheet reader's dates and opening/closing signs). Still owed: the `pstgres` typo on `.env` line 13 (every database line is commented out right now), `migrate deploy` + `db:seed:rbac` on the cloud test db, Anthropic credit, the Cultsport evidence files by hand. What it is: the ledger app's five-tab per-vendor screen ported 100 % (its own CSS scoped under `.bch-ledger`) at `/ledger/[id]`, reached only from a Ledger button on `/vendors/[id]`; the `/ledger` list page, its API and `gaps/new` removed; the two ledger modules made admin-only through `Module.assignable`; a one-time JSON import, S3 uploads with delete, and AI extraction of statement rows and draft claims that land only after a person accepts them. |
| `1509-assembly-queue-single-bin-and-product-assembly-level-plan.md` | 15 Sep 2026, Parts A–E by parallel agents, committed and pushed (`3d1cf9e`, `ef9810e`, `164f95a`, `f20e080`, `fe50ca2`). `/assembly` gains tabs and a searchable **Awaiting Assignment** list (`?q=`, paged, `only=pending`); the assembly condition level moves off the assign modal onto the product as `Product.assemblyLevel`, saved at the **first** assign via `updateMany … where assemblyLevel: null` so two simultaneous first assigns cannot overwrite each other, and editable from `/stock` and the details page behind `assembly.approve`; every received inbound line gets unit codes and lands in **one** bin, so `/bins` no longer shows a Loose row. Migration `3d1cf9e`, plus `ef9810e` repairing the drift the hand-written 12 Sep assembly migration left on `bch_local` (verified exit 0 both ways). **Owed:** `npm run build`, the browser walk, and `migrate deploy` on the test/production database — three migrations were pending there. |
| `1509-po-product-and-quantity-only-plan.md` | 15 Sep 2026, committed and pushed (`2ee15ec`, `f91ac5f`, `f7f8ab7`); **owed:** the owner's `npm run build` and the §4 browser walk. A purchase order is the product and the quantity — no rate, GST or totals are stored, and none are shown on `/purchase-orders/new`, the review (checkbox + product name only), the PDF (`# · Product · Qty`, both GSTINs kept), the vendor email, the WhatsApp text, the detail page or the list, older POs included. Reverses R1–R5 of the MRP plan below. No migration: the money columns are written as 0. |
| `1509-po-sheet-mrp-price-and-pdf-columns-plan.md` | **R1–R5 REVERSED the same day** by `1509-po-product-and-quantity-only-plan.md`; only R6 (no SKU/HSN on the PDF) survives. Originally: **BUILT 15 Sep 2026 on `feat/remove-static-team-health`**, committed and pushed on the owner's instruction. The sheet's MRP (else its BDP/Price) becomes the PO line's unit price, shown read-only and re-read by the server from the review row; GST defaults to 0; a row with no price cannot be selected; the PO PDF drops the SKU and HSN columns. No migration — it reuses `PoExtractionItem.price/mrp`. |
| `1509-reorder-inside-purchase-orders-plan.md` | 15 Sep 2026, committed as `efb1e0c` on `feat/remove-static-team-health`; tsc + eslint clean, the query verified against `bch_local`. **Owed:** the owner's `npm run build`, the §4 browser walk and `npm run db:seed:rbac` — the module's `route` becomes null, so a user with `/reorder` pinned in `navTabs` loses that tab until the re-seed runs. `/reorder` is now the Reorder tab of `/purchase-orders` (top tab bar Orders \| Reorder; `/reorder` redirects; sidebar entry removed via catalog `route: null`). New PO gains "Add reorder items": a modal of the chosen vendor's products (by `Product.reorderVendorId`) at or below their reorder level, 10 per page, searchable, at their `reorderQty` (0 when unset — must be set before submit). `/stock/[id]` gains a Reorder card. No migration. |
| `1509-stock-count-scope-by-warehouse-plan.md` | 15 Sep 2026, Parts C, A and B committed and pushed (`283a6fd`, `4e5eab2`). A stock count is **one store and one of its Floor/Godown warehouses**, with the bin optional and no "whole store" mode: `/stock-audit/new` asks store → warehouse → optional bin, and `stockCountSchema` makes `storeId` and `warehouseId` both required (`validations.ts:197-200`), re-checked by the create route. Q4 was answered **b** — the store is never derived from the bin — so the whole-store branches are gone rather than inferred. The zod messages sit on the base type as well as on `.min`, because a *missing* field fails the type check first and used to reach the screen as "Invalid input: expected string, received undefined". No migration. **Owed:** `npm run build` and the browser walk. |
| `analytics-merge-plan.md` | store analytics merged; /analytics, CountEvent and the device endpoints are live |
| `app-logic-and-problems-removal-plan.md` | 30 Aug 2026, `/more/app-logic`, `/more/problems`, `/api/problems`, the `AppProblem` model and the `problems` module all deleted (commit `63d1d37`). The table never existed in this database, so `db push` dropped nothing — the schema had drifted ahead of it |
| `ci-build-database-dependency-plan.md` | 29 Aug 2026, the three Staff LMS pages became client components so the build opens no database connection, and the CI trigger no longer filters on `main` |
| `cron-removal-plan.md` | 28 Aug 2026, all cron jobs and screen polling removed |
| `database-reset-preserving-integrations-plan.md` | 29 Aug 2026, closed WITHOUT implementation — only `ZOHO_BOOKS` was ever connected and its row is backed up by hand in `.env`, so the export/restore scripts were unnecessary. Kept for §0 and the reset runbook |
| `frontend-role-check-removal-plan.md` | 30 Aug 2026, all 21 dead role-name gates replaced with permission checks across 18 files, plus `activity.approve` in the catalog. 19 denied everyone; **2 failed OPEN** — `/price-correction` was rendering for every signed-in user, so fixing it removes access. **Not yet tested as a non-admin**, which is the only test that proves that half |
| `master-data-screens-and-filter-ui-plan.md` | 30 Aug 2026, three of four parts. **A** product delete — soft by default, hard delete behind blocker counts, plus restore (`eda3013`); **C** `BrandLeadTime` folded into `Brand.leadDays` with `/more/brands` as the master (`1e4ed73`); **D** the filter sheet became a right drawer across all 12 screens (`78d388f`). **Part B (Categories) was moved out, not built** — it is now `pending/sidebar-categories-and-accounts-trim-plan.md`. Q1 was answered by the implementation; §7's other questions went with Part B |
| `s3-cors-upload-failure-plan.md` | 30 Aug 2026, on `perf/single-auth-query-v2`. Browser uploads died at the S3 preflight because the bucket allowed no origin — and the storage self-test could not catch it, since every step ran server-side where no preflight exists. Three fixes: a size-capped fallback through `/api/upload` so a missing CORS rule no longer breaks uploads, `applyCors` merging origins instead of replacing them (it used to revoke whichever environment pressed it last), and a real CORS step in the test. **§8 not yet run** — build, plus a browser upload before and after pressing Apply CORS |
| `service-merge-plan.md` | bch-service merged; /services/* and the SERVICE_* roles are live |
| `sidebar-categories-and-accounts-trim-plan.md` | 31 Aug 2026, both parts, `e0cff4f` on `feat/categories-module`. Bills & Payments and Expenses left the sidebar via `route: null` — hidden, NOT removed, because `bills` is referenced by 20 files including the Zoho pull and settlement. The `categories` module (Purchase, 225), `/more/categories` and the missing PATCH/DELETE/merge routes all exist; merge refuses when the source has children, delete refuses with counts, and GET stayed on `stock.view` so no product form loses its dropdown. Seeded. **§6 browser pass NOT run** — the screen has never been opened |
| `single-auth-query-plan.md` | `getAccess` is the single reader of the User row: **3 database round trips per guarded request → 1**, across 190 route files, with no route file touched. `getCurrentUser` reads `getAccess` and is `cache()`d, and the next-auth `jwt` callback no longer re-reads the row for a role label nothing authorises on. Code complete; **`npm run build` not yet run**, uncommitted on `perf/single-auth-query-v2` |
| `stock-management-module-and-zoho-item-removal-plan.md` | 2 Sep 2026, all five parts on `refactor/stock-management-module` (`2ed0202`, `7af57e0`, `91fdef8`, `c02dff9`, `0776795`). **A** the Zoho *item* import is gone — both entry points, the whole uncalled `api/zoho/import/` tree, `backfill-size`, `parseBicycleSize`, the `/settings/integrations` pull card and its `pull-review` page, plus the `/ai` page and its three AI routes. The `trigger-pull` / `pull-review` / `approve` **APIs survive**: `/inbound`, `/bills`, `/receivables` and `/deliveries` each run that sequence inline. `api/ai/dashboard-insights` turned out to contain no AI at all and to feed the Stock Value and Low Stock tiles, so it was **renamed** to `api/dashboard/stats` rather than deleted. Two things the plan marked for deletion were **kept on the owner's decision** — `import-placeholders.ts` and `BooksClient.getItem` — because the bill import remains a product-creation path (§16.1). **B** the `ProductType` enum is now a table (`name`, `sortOrder`, `isActive`) with a `/product-types` screen; `Product.type` became a required `productTypeId` and both indexes were repointed. The plan predicted the build would pass while the screens broke, and §15.2/§15.3 were right — ~23 call sites, not ten. **C** `stock`, `product_types`, `stock_audit`, `inbound`, `deliveries` and `transfers` are children of a new `stock_management` parent, **keys unchanged so every role grant survived**; the parent carries a real route because the phone bottom bar filters to roots. New hub page at `/stock-management`. **D** `/customers` — the list screen the `customers` module always claimed; the API was already complete, only the page was missing, and outstanding balance is one `groupBy` per page. **E** the catalog was loaded from the owner export, active rows only. Seeded: 49 modules, 179 permissions. `npm run build` passes. **Two things still owed:** the §13 browser checklist has never been walked (§17.7, §18.5, §20.5), and `stock_management.view` plus the `product_types` actions are granted to ADMIN only — someone must grant them on `/team/permissions`. Supersedes `imported-product-data-quality-plan.md` |
| `storage-implementation-plan.md` | 28 Aug 2026, runtime-switchable storage provider and Settings module |
| `store-hierarchy-and-team-plan.md` | 30 Aug 2026, all six phases. The `StockLocation` enum is gone — `Store` and `Warehouse` are tables, `/stores` administers them behind a `store_management` parent module, and `/stock/by-location/[code]` resolves either level. The §2.4 database reset was skipped as unnecessary and no data was lost. **The §6 browser pass has not been run** — an audit after the phases were called done found five bugs the green build could not see |
| `zoho-config-consolidation-plan.md` | 29 Aug 2026, three Zoho config tables and four clients collapsed into one `IntegrationConfig` row per provider, one `IntegrationClient` base class and three `[provider]` routes |
| `zoho-provider-endpoint-registry-plan.md` | 31 Aug 2026, all four parts (`67be82d`, `7c16903`, `631db1d`, `0cff195`). **A** `endpoints.ts` lists all 16 endpoints + 2 OAuth grants and `apiCall` logs a stable key instead of an interpolated URL — it also stopped logging entire request bodies. **C** clients are request-scoped, so the approve loop pays one `init()` instead of one per record. **D** the four raw `apiCall` sites are gone and `apiCall` is `protected`, so the compiler enforces the boundary. **B** 34 sites through the factory — which **revived two Zoho writes that had never worked**: inbound's item push and the DELIVERED bill push both skipped `init()` and failed silently. **Part E (batch-size guidance on the approve screen) NOT built**; §7's manual checks unrun |
| `zoho-pull-timeout-plan.md` | 30 Aug 2026, both `items` loops and `contacts` batched into a fixed number of queries; `maxDuration` 30 -> 60 (headroom, not the fix). Commits `8f143d2`, `947781f`. **§8 not yet run** — the acceptance test is a real 90-day pull returning without a 504, plus the `ZOHO_BOOKS` fallback exercised separately |

| Plan | State |
|---|---|
| `ai-provider-config-and-task-routing-plan.md` | nothing built. Moves the AI provider key and the per-task model out of `.env` and out of hardcoded strings into three tables behind a `settings_ai` module, so switching provider for a month is a dropdown rather than a deploy. Writing config back to `.env` at runtime was **considered and rejected** (§2) — Node reads `process.env` once per process, so it would mean "change it, then restart". Adds `AiCallLog`, without which the owner's month-over-month billing comparison is impossible: audit F9 records that real spend today is **unknown**. Follows `StorageConfig` for the 30 s cache, the env bootstrap fallback and the activate-guarded provider switch, and `IntegrationConfig` for never serialising the secret at all. **Two blocking questions (Q1, Q2)**, and §11.1 argues this should run AFTER the audit's F1/F2/F3 data-loss fixes |
| `notifications-and-settings-rbac-plan.md` | nothing built, no file changed, no dependency installed. Two halves. **Part A** collapses Settings into **one module whose actions name the section** (`storage_edit`, `whatsapp_edit`, `push_edit`, `email_edit`): `settings_storage` and `whatsapp_templates` are deleted as modules, `zoho` gets `route: null` so it leaves the sidebar while all **19** of its guards elsewhere stay untouched — the same routeless-and-childless skip that already hides `cost_price`. §A3 lists all **10** guard call sites with line numbers. **Part A is destructive**: `seed-rbac.ts:143-169` deletes stale modules and permissions, and `Permission.module` + `RolePermission.permission` are both `onDelete: Cascade`, so every custom role holding those grants loses them **the moment the re-seed runs** — and ADMIN is re-granted everything, so it looks fine to whoever tests as an admin. Hence the two-phase migration in §A4, whose Phase 2 should be **deleted rather than written** if the read-only Phase-1 query returns zero rows (Q2). Three further findings: the action union lives in **three files with no compile-time link**, and `ACTION_ORDER` sorts with `indexOf` so a missing action gets `-1` and renders **ahead of `view`** rather than erroring; WhatsApp templates are already inconsistent today, **read** on `whatsapp_templates.view` but **written** on `settings.edit` via `PUT /api/alerts/config`; and §E.2's personal-preferences surface **has nowhere to live** — this app has no profile or account page at all (Q6). **Part B–F** adds push and email. **AWS was considered and rejected** (§2.1): Android has exactly one push transport, FCM, so SNS means creating Firebase anyway, then maintaining per-device SNS endpoints, and *still* building a separate VAPID path because SNS has **no browser transport** — FCM alone covers app and web. Email is SMTP via a Gmail App Password, needing **nothing from Google Cloud**; Gmail OAuth was rejected because `gmail.send` is a Google **restricted** scope (verification + third-party security assessment) and the Testing-mode escape **expires the refresh token every 7 days** — both walls vanish on Workspace, neither does on a free `@gmail.com`. The ~500/day free Gmail cap is why email defaults **off** per event while push defaults on. §D.3 records the cost nobody should discover late: **Android WebView does not implement the Web Push API**, so the service worker reaches desktop browsers and *not* the app — the app needs the native plugin, a rebuild and a **reinstall on every device**, which breaks the current "web changes reach the app instantly" property of `server.url`. Five models, two named deviations from `database-architect.md`. Per the owner's D2 the design is **event-only, no scheduler**, honouring the no-cron rule with the loss stated plainly: nothing will ever report an overdue bill or a stale sync. **§9 collides with `ai-provider-config-and-task-routing-plan.md`** — its §8 creates a `settings_ai` module following `settings_storage` *"exactly"*, the very pattern this plan abolishes; one of the two must be amended. **Three blocking questions (Q1, Q2, Q6)** |

## Caveat: two files were filed against their own status lines

Status headers in this repo had gone stale. These two were classified by **what the code
actually shows**, not by what the document claimed about itself:

- **`analytics-merge-plan.md`** said *"Status: plan. Nothing implemented yet."* — but the
  `analytics` module, `/analytics` screens, `CountEvent`, `FootfallDaily` and the device
  ingest endpoints all exist. Filed as completed.
- **`service-merge-plan.md`** said *"Status: plan, plus the RBAC groundwork already
  seeded"* — but CLAUDE.md documents `/services/*` as the merged former `bch-service` app,
  and the screens, models and `SERVICE_*` roles are all present. Filed as completed.

Both status lines have since been corrected. This is the failure mode the strict token and
the hooks above exist to prevent.
