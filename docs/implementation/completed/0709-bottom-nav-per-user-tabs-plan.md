# Bottom navigation — make the per-user pin actually drive the PWA tab bar

Status: completed — 8 Sep 2026, the pinned tabs reach the phone: one `MAX_NAV_TABS` cap, `navTabs` carried through `rbac` → `/api/my-permissions` → the client store, the bar hidden outright when nothing is pinned, and a header drawer as the safety net.
Branch: **not cut yet.** Ask the owner which branch to base this on before creating one.

## The report

> "When I select the bottom navigation in the permission for the role it's not reflecting the

Reproduced by reading the code. The setting is saved correctly and then ignored by everything
that renders. **No schema change is required** — the column already exists.

---

## 1. Root cause — the write path is complete, the read path was never built

`User.navTabs` (`prisma/schema.prisma:362`, column present since `prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql:231`)
is written by the admin UI and read back into that same admin form, which is why the selection
*looks* saved and sticky. Nothing on the rendering side has ever read it.

The chain breaks at five consecutive links:

| # | Link | File | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Admin picks/orders/removes tabs | `src/app/(dashboard)/team/[id]/page.tsx:156-170, 310-395` | works |
| 2 | `PUT` sanitises against real routes, de-dupes, caps, persists | `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts:96-108` | works |
| 3 | `getAccess()` selects the user row | `src/lib/rbac.ts:121-140` | **never selects `navTabs`** |
| 4 | `ResolvedAccess` carries the user | `src/lib/rbac.ts:80-101` | **no `navTabs` field** |
| 5 | `GET /api/my-permissions` returns the bootstrap | `src/app/api/my-permissions/route.ts:16-21` | **omits `navTabs`** |
| 6 | Client store holds grants | `src/stores/permissions.ts:49-56, 86-99` | **no `navTabs`** |
| 7 | The tab bar renders | `src/components/bottom-nav.tsx:23-25` | **ignores the pin** |

Link 7 is the visible symptom. `bottom-nav.tsx` builds its middle tabs as:

```ts
const middle = modules
  .filter((m) => !m.parent && m.route && m.route !== "/")
  .slice(0, MAX_MIDDLE_TABS);
```

— the first three granted **root** modules by `Module.sortOrder`. The admin's choice never
enters the expression. Change the pin, and the bar is byte-identical because `sortOrder`
did not move.

### 1a. Second, independent bug — the cap disagrees with itself

`MAX_NAV_TABS = 4` in **two** places (`team/[id]/page.tsx:53`, `api/users/[id]/route.ts:14`)
but `MAX_MIDDLE_TABS = 3` in `bottom-nav.tsx:13`. The admin can pin a 4th tab, the API will
happily store it, and the bar would silently drop it. Three copies of one number in three
files is why they drifted; the fix is one exported constant, not three edits.

### 1b. What does NOT exist

`/team/permissions` (`src/app/(dashboard)/team/permissions/page.tsx`) edits role→permission
grants only. The `Role` model (`prisma/schema.prisma:82-97`) has **no nav column**. There is no
role-level nav pinning anywhere in the codebase — the only pinning is per-user, on the user's
own edit page. Confirmed with the owner: per-user is the intended behaviour, so nothing
role-level is being built here.

---

## 2. Decisions taken (owner, 7 Sep 2026)

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Per-user or per-role? | **Per-user**, edited where it is today — on the user's edit page. |
| Nothing pinned? | **Hide the bottom bar completely.** Not the current "auto-pick their top 3". |
| How many tabs? | **Cap stays 4.** The bar renders up to 4 middle tabs (Home + 4 + More = 6). |

---

## 3. Blocking concern the owner must read before Phase 3

**On mobile, the bottom bar is the only navigation that exists.** `src/components/header.tsx`
is a logo, the user's name and an avatar circle — there is no menu button, no drawer, no links
(the whole file is 38 lines; a grep for `Menu|drawer|Sheet|Link` returns nothing). The desktop
sidebar is `hidden lg:flex` (`src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx:35`).

So a user with an empty `navTabs` on a phone gets **no bottom bar, no More button and no menu**.
They land on `/` and can only reach whatever that page happens to link to. This also strands the
admin who is configuring it, on their own phone, with no route back to `/team`.

This follows directly from the chosen behaviour and is not a reason to refuse it — but it should
be a deliberate choice, not a discovery in production. **Phase 4 is the safety net and I
recommend shipping it in the same PR.** If the owner declines Phase 4, ship Phases 1-3 as
specified and treat empty-`navTabs` as an admin error to avoid.

---

## 4. Phases

### Phase 1 — one cap constant, three call sites

**New:** `src/lib/nav-tabs.ts`

```ts
/** Maximum bottom-nav tabs an admin may pin. Home and More sit outside this count.
 *  Lived in three files and drifted (4 / 4 / 3), so the 4th pinned tab never rendered. */
export const MAX_NAV_TABS = 4;
```

**Edit:** delete the local constant in `team/[id]/page.tsx:53` and `api/users/[id]/route.ts:14`;
delete `MAX_MIDDLE_TABS` in `bottom-nav.tsx:13`. All three import from `@/lib/nav-tabs`.

No behaviour change on its own. Done first so Phase 3 has one number to honour.

### Phase 2 — carry `navTabs` from the database to the client

Four small edits, one per broken link:

1. **`src/lib/rbac.ts`** — add `navTabs: true` to the `prisma.user.findUnique` select
   (~line 130, beside `warehouseId`), and `navTabs: string[]` to `ResolvedAccess.user`
   (~line 96) with a comment saying it is a display preference, not a grant. Add
   `navTabs: []` to `EMPTY_ACCESS`. This rides the existing single User read — **no extra
   query**, which is the property `getAccess` was built to hold.
2. **`src/app/api/my-permissions/route.ts`** — return `navTabs: access.user?.navTabs ?? []`
   in the payload.
3. **`src/stores/permissions.ts`** — `navTabs: string[]` on the state, set it in the success
   branch (~line 91), and clear it to `[]` in the two reset/failure branches (~lines 96-99,
   134-139) so a signed-out user cannot inherit the last user's bar.
4. **`src/lib/use-permissions.ts`** — subscribe and return `navTabs`.

Logging (`createLogger("nav:tabs")`): `log.debug` the resolved tab count on load. Nothing here
is a secret; log counts and routes, never the user row.

### Phase 3 — render the pin, hide the bar when there is none

**New:** `src/lib/use-bottom-nav.ts` — one hook, so the bar and the layout can never disagree
about whether a bar exists.

```ts
// Resolves the tabs this user's bar should show.
//   - `navTabs` is admin intent; `modules` is what the role actually grants.
//   - INTERSECT the two, in the admin's order. A pinned route whose grant was later revoked
//     must not render: the team page already warns "role no longer grants this - won't show",
//     and the frontend is cosmetic anyway (the route re-checks), but a dead tab is a bug.
//   - Empty result => no bar at all (owner decision, 7 Sep).
```

Returns `{ tabs, loading, hasNav }`.

**Edit `src/components/bottom-nav.tsx`:** consume the hook. Delete the `.slice(0, N)` on
`sortOrder`. `if (!hasNav) return null`.

**While `loading`:** render **nothing** (no bar, no reserved space) rather than the current
5-cell skeleton. A skeleton would flash a bar that then vanishes for exactly the users who have
none. Users with tabs get one small shift when grants land; the store resolves once per session.
*If the owner prefers no shift over no flash, keep the skeleton and accept the flash — flag it.*

**Edit `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`:** the layout must stop reserving space when there is no
bar. `main` uses `pb-nav` (`src/app/globals.css:59-61`), and **nine** other elements position
themselves with `.above-nav` (`globals.css:69-71`) across `accounts/reconcile/[id]`,
`deliveries/dispatch`, `receivables`, `services/counter`, `stock`, `stock-audit/brand-count`,
`team/permissions`, `transfers/new`, `transfers/[id]`.

**Do not edit those eleven files.** Both rules resolve `var(--bottom-nav-height)`
(`globals.css:6`), and custom properties inherit — so overriding the variable on the layout root
corrects every dependent at once:

```css
/* globals.css - the bar is per-user now; when it is absent nothing may reserve its height. */
.nav-hidden { --bottom-nav-height: 0px; }
```

```tsx
<div className={cn("flex min-h-screen", !hasNav && "nav-hidden")}>
```

That is the root-cause fix. Patching `pb-nav` alone would leave nine fixed elements floating
64px above a bar that is not there.

**Edit `team/[id]/page.tsx:315-318`** — the helper text is now wrong. It reads "Leave empty to
use their highest-priority modules automatically." It must say that leaving it empty means the
person gets **no bottom navigation on their phone**, and warn when the admin is about to save an
empty list.

### Phase 4 — the safety net (recommended; owner's call — see §3)

Add a menu button to `src/components/header.tsx` opening the existing module list (the same
`modules` the `/more` page already renders, `src/app/(dashboard)/more/page.tsx:17,64-72`) so
mobile navigation never depends on the bar being present. Without this, an empty pin is
unrecoverable on a phone.

### Phase 5 — delete dead code

`src/components/lms-bottom-nav.tsx` is a hardcoded `NAV_ITEMS` bar that **nothing imports**
(a grep for `LmsBottomNav` across `src` returns only its own definition). It is a second,
divergent answer to this exact question sitting in the tree waiting to be copied. Delete it,
or say why it stays.

## 5. Files touched

| File | Phase | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `src/lib/nav-tabs.ts` | 1 | new — the one cap constant |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/team/[id]/page.tsx` | 1, 3 | import the constant; correct the helper text |
| `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` | 1 | import the constant |
| `src/lib/rbac.ts` | 2 | select + type `navTabs` |
| `src/app/api/my-permissions/route.ts` | 2 | return `navTabs` |
| `src/stores/permissions.ts` | 2 | hold + clear `navTabs` |
| `src/lib/use-permissions.ts` | 2 | expose `navTabs` |
| `src/lib/use-bottom-nav.ts` | 3 | new — resolve pin against grants |
| `src/components/bottom-nav.tsx` | 1, 3 | render the pin; return null when empty |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` | 3 | `.nav-hidden` when no bar |
| `src/app/globals.css` | 3 | `.nav-hidden { --bottom-nav-height: 0px }` |
| `src/components/header.tsx` | 4 | mobile menu (optional) |
| `src/components/lms-bottom-nav.tsx` | 5 | delete |

**No migration.** `navTabs` already exists in `0_init`. Nothing in `prisma/` changes, so none of
the migration rules in CLAUDE.md are engaged.

## 6. What might break

- **`/more` is unaffected** — it renders `modules`, not `navTabs`, and stays the full menu.
- **Desktop is unaffected** — the bar is `lg:hidden` already; `.nav-hidden` only zeroes a
  variable that desktop does not use for `main` (`lg:pb-10`).
  *Observation, pre-existing:* `.above-nav` elements offset by 64px on desktop where no bar has
  ever rendered. Out of scope; not introduced here.
- **Every existing user has `navTabs = []`** (the column default, never written for anyone the
  admin has not edited). **Shipping Phase 3 therefore removes the bottom bar for every user at
  once** until an admin pins tabs for each of them. This is the single biggest operational
  consequence of the plan and it needs the owner's explicit sign-off, plus a decision:
  backfill each user's current auto-picked three into `navTabs` before the deploy, or accept
  the blank slate. **Ask before building Phase 3.**

## 7. Verification

1. `npm run build` must pass (background it — it exceeds the 10-minute foreground limit).
2. `/team/<user>` → pin 2 tabs → save → reload that user's session on a phone or a narrow
   viewport: exactly those 2 appear, in that order, between Home and More.
3. Pin 4 → all 4 render (this is the `MAX_NAV_TABS` drift regression test).
4. Reorder with the arrows → the bar order follows.
5. Pin a module, then revoke that module's `view` from the role → the tab disappears and the
   team page shows its "role no longer grants this" warning.
6. Clear all pins → no bar, and **no dead 64px gap** at the bottom of `/stock`,
   `/receivables` and `/transfers/new` (the `.above-nav` pages).
7. Sign out and in as a user with a different pin → no bleed from the previous user's bar.

## Clarifications

**7 Sep 2026, owner** — per-user not per-role; empty means hide the bar entirely; cap stays 4.
Raised in return: the mobile header has no navigation of its own, so "hide entirely" strands a
phone user with no pins (§3), and every existing user currently has an empty `navTabs` (§6).
Both need a decision before Phase 3 is built.
