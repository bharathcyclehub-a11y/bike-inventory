# The ledger app's vendor screens, exactly as they are, behind a Ledger button on the vendor page — with a one-time JSON import, S3 uploads and AI extraction

Status: completed — 16 Sep 2026, Parts A–F shipped as `55acd4f`, which is an ancestor of `feat/remove-static-team-health`. The ledger app's five-tab per-vendor screen lives at `/ledger/[id]` (its CSS scoped under `.bch-ledger`), reached only from a Ledger button on `/vendors/[id]`; the `/ledger` list page, its API and `gaps/new` are deleted; both ledger modules are admin-only through `Module.assignable`; and the one-time JSON import, S3 uploads with delete and AI extraction of statement rows and draft claims all landed, the AI results only after a person accepts them. API side verified against local `bch` by curl on 9 Sep, migration `20260909162948_vendor_ledger_profile_uploads` applied locally. Build record in §6. Still owed by the owner: `npm run build`, the browser walk in `docs/manual-testing/0909-vendor-ledger-verification.md`, `migrate deploy` + `db:seed:rbac` on the test/production database, and Anthropic credit before the AI path can run.
Branch: **`feat/0909-vendor-ledger-screens`** — cut from `feat/0909-stock-po-expense` @ `39dfb81`
on 9 Sep 2026 once the owner named it (Q9); the PO-sheet work this plan waited on is commit
`54fd2d4` on that base.

Everything in §2 and §3 was read from the code on disk on **9 Sep 2026**: the ledger app at
`F:\bharath  Cycle\ledgers\app`, and this repository. Nothing is carried over from
`ledger-merge-plan.md`; where the two disagree, this plan wins and says so.

### 0.2 Restated as requirements

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **R1** | Document how the ledger app stores and shows its data (done — §2.1). |
| **R2** | On the vendor detail screen (`/vendors/[id]`) add a **Ledger** button. Clicking it opens the screen the ledger app shows for that vendor. |
| **R3** | That screen reproduces the ledger app's per-vendor screen **completely**: every tab (Ledger, Monthly, Table, Gaps, Share), every action, the same UI. Nothing left out. |
| **R4** | The ledger app's own brand **listing is not wanted**. The BCH-side `/ledger` list page and its sidebar entry are removed; the vendor page is the only way in. |
| **R5** | Decide the storage: which tables to add, whether any JSON body belongs in S3, which column types. Answered in §1 (Q3 of the first round) and built in §3 Part A: rows in Postgres, files in S3, raw AI output in a Json column. |
| **R6** | Deleting: a hand-added entry deletes after a confirm, as in the app. An **imported** row is never deleted; the × marks it ignored instead. |
| **R7** | The two ledger permission modules are **admin-only**: they cannot be assigned to any role other than the system role. |
| **R8** | A **one-time JSON import** on the vendor's ledger screen: the owner picks the vendor, uploads the ledger app's JSON export, chooses which brand in it is this vendor, and the data is written to the database. It exists until setup is done and can be removed afterwards. |
| **R9** | The source of truth for that import is a JSON export taken from the owner's device (Data → Export JSON in the ledger app), not the Vercel Blob. |
| **R10** | AI: upload files from the UI, optionally give a prompt, run AI over them, review, and commit. Both jobs ship in **this** phase: statement import (PDF, XLSX, CSV → ledger rows) and prompt-driven extraction over chat exports and screenshots (→ draft claims). |
| **R11** | Uploaded files are stored in **S3**. |
| **R12** | Any uploaded file can be **deleted from S3** from the UI at any time after upload, including after extraction has finished. |

## 1. Questions and clarifications — answer before build

### 1.1 Decisions on record (owner, 9 Sep 2026)

| # | Question | Answer | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Replace the shipped `/ledger/[id]` or add beside it? | **Replace.** Remove the `/ledger` list page and its sidebar entry. | `brand_ledger.route` becomes `null` (the `bills` precedent, `prisma/rbac-catalog.ts:369-394`); `ledger/page.tsx` and `GET /api/ledger/vendors` are deleted; `/ledger/[id]` keeps its URL and is reached only from the vendor button. |
| D2 | How exact is "same UI"? | **100 %.** | `styles.css` is ported as a scoped stylesheet; the JSX structure, labels, chips, tab order and copy are kept verbatim (§3 Part C). |
| D3 | Delete rules | Keep the safeguard. Imported rows → ignored; hand-added rows → deleted after confirm. | The × on a row calls the review endpoint with `IGNORED` when `source ≠ MANUAL`, and the delete endpoint otherwise (§3 Part B.6). |
| D4 | Permissions | Admin-only; not assignable to any other role. | `Module.assignable` column, enforced at the two role-write routes by `role.isSystem`, never by role name (§3 Part A.3). |
| D5 | Migration of existing data | A one-time **Import JSON** button on the vendor's ledger screen; JSON only; removable afterwards. | §3 Part D. |
| D6 | Source of truth for it | A JSON export from the device. | The import reads the ledger app's export shape (`store.js:47-55`, same document as `loadState`). |
| D7 | AI scope | Everything in phase one. | §3 Part E builds statement import **and** the prompt flow. |
| D8 | Storage | S3, with delete-from-S3 at any time. | §3 Part E.1 and E.5. |

### 1.2 Answered one by one, 9 Sep 2026 — the Answer column is the decision

| # | Question | Why it changes the build | Options | Recommended default | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Q1** | **Stored files are world-readable today.** `S3Provider.publicUrl` (`src/lib/storage/s3.ts:51-53`) is the URL saved in the database and nothing signs a GET; `src/lib/po-extraction/store.ts:226-228` states objects are "world-readable by design". A supplier statement or a WhatsApp export is not a product photo. | Gating reads means a new `read(key)` on `StorageProvider` and an authenticated proxy route; not gating means anyone with the URL opens the file. | (a) gate every ledger file behind `GET /api/ledger/files/[id]` (`requireFeature("brand_ledger","view")`, streams from S3, URL never leaves the server); (b) accept public URLs. | **(a).** The key is only as secret as `Date.now()` + six random characters (`upload-policy.ts:95-99`). | **Public URLs.** Owner, 9 Sep 2026: "dont worry store it  we will delete after some time". No gated route; B.9 dropped; the stored S3 URL is used directly, and the R12 delete is the control. |
| **Q2** | WhatsApp exports arrive as `.zip` (the `chat/` folders and the root zips). No zip library is a direct dependency; `fflate@0.8.2` is on disk only transitively via `xlsx` and `jspdf`. | A new dependency, or `.zip` refused at upload. | (a) add `fflate` as a direct dependency and read `_chat.txt` out of the zip on the server; (b) accept `.txt` only and ask the owner to unzip. | **(a).** | **(a)** — add `fflate`, accept `.zip`. |
| **Q3** | The JSON export carries **no image bytes**. The five evidence files (`app/public/evidence/cultsport/*`) are referenced by name in `evidence.gen.js`, not in the export. | Whether the import creates evidence rows. | (a) the import creates no evidence rows; the five files are attached by hand on gaps CULT-2, CULT-3, CULT-4, CULT-6, CULT-13 through the new evidence upload; (b) extend the import to accept a zip of evidence. | **(a).** Five files, once. | **(a)** — attached by hand after import. |
| **Q4** | Brand → vendor. Seven of the eight brands match a vendor on local `bch` (aoki → AOKI MOBILITY, cultsport → CULTSPORT PVT LTD, hornback → HORNBACK E MOBILITY, lucifer → LUCIFER BIKES, raleigh → NAREN INTERNATIONAL, trinity → TRINITY CYCLES, emotorad → INKODOP TECHNOLOGIES). **Tata Stryder has no vendor row.** CULTGEAR PVT LTD also exists beside CULTSPORT. | The import needs a target vendor per brand; the picker in §3 Part D makes the owner choose, so the code never guesses. | Create the Tata Stryder vendor at `/vendors/new` before importing; confirm CULTSPORT (not CULTGEAR) and Inkodop for EMotorad. | As stated. | **Confirmed** as stated; the owner creates the Tata Stryder vendor before its import. |
| **Q5** | EMotorad has two folios in the app (Centre 121, Hub 666) but one ledger thread and one vendor. | Nothing in the schema; noted so the import is not expected to split them. | Import as one vendor. | Import as one. | **One vendor** (Inkodop). |
| **Q6** | Chat extraction is not one call. A 9,343-message export is far beyond a single prompt, and `runAi` has **no attachment or prompt size cap** (`src/lib/ai/index.ts:201` only logs the size). | Chunk size and model effort decide cost and quality. | Chunk by message count with a running summary; `effort: "high"`; the active provider's default model. | Chunks of ~1,500 messages, each producing candidate claims with the quoted message and line number; results are **proposals**, never rows, until accepted. | **Chunks of ~1,500 messages.** |
| **Q7** | The ledger screen's opening balance. The app uses `brand.ledger.opening.amount` (`store.js:123`); the shipped API uses `vendor.openingBalance` (`api/ledger/vendors/[id]/route.ts:89-90`), which is BCH's own book figure as of 1 Apr 2026. EMotorad's ledger opens at ₹64,78,990 on 1 Apr 2025. | Which number seeds the running balance. | A new `ledgerOpeningAmount`/`ledgerOpeningDate` on the profile table; `Vendor.openingBalance` untouched. | The profile fields. | **Profile fields.** |
| **Q8** | Gap IDs like `CULT-3` come from a hardcoded map (`App.jsx:16`). | Display only. | `VendorLedgerProfile.code` (4 letters), defaulting to the first four letters of `Vendor.code` on import. | The profile column. | **Profile column**, set from the app's map on import (CULT, LUCI, EMOT, AOKI, RALE, HORN, TRIN, TATA). |
| **Q9** | **Which branch is this built on?** The uncommitted PO-sheet work must be committed first. | Base and ordering. | The owner names the base (memory rule: ask before each new branch). | — | **The owner names it when saying "implement"** — "i will tell u when i mention and tell implemt". Nothing is checked out before that. |

## 2. How it works today — verified against the code

### 2.1 The ledger app (`F:\bharath  Cycle\ledgers\app`)

**One JSON document, no database.** `store.js:3` names the localStorage key `bch-ledgers-v1`;
`saveState` (`store.js:36-40`) rewrites the whole document `{ ...state, version, savedAt }` on
every edit. `sync.js:69-72` pushes it two seconds after any change to `PUT /api/state`;
`api/state.js:26-37` writes it to Vercel Blob as `bch/state-<timestamp>.json` and keeps the five
newest. `initialSync` (`sync.js:75-89`) pulls on launch and the newer `savedAt` wins, so two
editors overwrite each other silently. Access is a shared PIN in the `x-sync-key` header
(`api/state.js:7-10`); the lock screen (`App.jsx:88-124`) is client-side only.

**"Push to git and the app reflects."** The starting data is compiled into the bundle:
`src/seed.js` (428 lines, brand cards and gaps hand-transcribed from `brands/<brand>/gaps.md`)
imports `src/entries.gen.js` (215 KB), which `scripts/extract-entries.mjs` generates from the
CSV/XLSX statements in the repo and `bank-statements/normalized.json`. A push rebuilds on Vercel;
`store.migrate` (`store.js:6-21`) merges the new seed entries with manual (`man-*`) entries on
each device when `SEED_VERSION` bumps.

**The document shape** (dumped from the seed on 9 Sep 2026: 8 brands, 219 gaps, 1,498 entries,
329,772 bytes):

| Level | Fields | Read at |
|---|---|---|
| brand | `id, name, sub, updated, lastReviewed, position, notes, theirBal{amount,label}, ourBal{amount,label}, recov{amount,text}, deadline{label,date}, ledger{opening{date,amount}, coverage, matchable, note}` | `App.jsx:227-263, 537-564, 590, 910, 1015` |
| entry | `id, date, type, ref, amount, dir, side, note, audit{s,t,g}` — `type` ∈ payment, invoice, credit-note, debit-note, discount, adjustment, **note**; `audit.s` ∈ ok, short, missing, kids, era20, info; `audit.g` = gap number | `App.jsx:508-529, 600-634`, `store.js:106-130` |
| gap | `n, title, type, amt, amtText, status, tier, evidence, action, result, progress[{date,text}]` — `status` ∈ open, promised, verify, resolved, rejected; `tier` ∈ firm, conditional, leverage, verify | `App.jsx:346-381, 1013-1019` |
| evidence | `evidence.gen.js` — `{brandId: {gapN: [{file, doc?, date, source, note}]}}`, files under `public/evidence/<brand>/` | `App.jsx:764-786` |

**The per-vendor screen** is `BrandPage` (`App.jsx:223-282`) with five tabs. The complete
component inventory, every field each reads, and every field each writes, is in §3 Part C.

### 2.2 What this repository already has (commit `e3d1e60`, on every branch)

`ledger-merge-plan.md` chose "port the method, not the app" and built a **different** UI. On
disk today:

| Piece | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| 7 models | `prisma/schema.prisma:2622-2848` — `BrandLedgerEntry`, `BrandStatement`, `LedgerGap`, `LedgerGapEvidence`, `LedgerGapNote`, `VendorDiscountTerm`, `BrandVendor` | shipped; **0 rows** in every one on local `bch` |
| enums | `LedgerEntryType:2530` (OPENING, INVOICE, PAYMENT, CREDIT_NOTE, DEBIT_NOTE, DISCOUNT, ADJUSTMENT — **no NOTE**), `GapType:2569` (12 values, all 10 of the app's present), `GapTier:2589`, `GapStatus:2596` (OPEN, PROMISED, VERIFY, RESOLVED, REJECTED), `EvidenceKind:2604`, `LedgerEntrySource:2561` | shipped |
| RBAC | `prisma/rbac-catalog.ts:460-469` `brand_ledger` (route `/ledger`), `:470-480` `brand_ledger_gaps` (route `null`, has `approve`) | seeded |
| engine | `src/lib/brand-ledger/reconcile.ts` — `parseLedgerDate:24`, `classifyEntry:64`, `directionForType:81`, `runningBalance:104`, `checkBalance:122`, `matchEntries:183`, `unclaimedBooks:245`, `assessCoverage:269`, `expectedDiscount:330` | pure, reusable |
| API | `api/ledger/vendors/route.ts` (list), `vendors/[id]/route.ts` (detail, read-only, `:22-140`), `vendors/[id]/entries/route.ts` (POST `:15`, DELETE `:53`), `entries/[id]/review/route.ts` (PUT `:16`), `vendors/[id]/gaps/route.ts` (GET `:10`, POST `:48`), `gaps/[id]/route.ts` (PUT `:16` with the `approve` check at `:31`, DELETE `:69`) | shipped; no `createLogger`, every `catch` silent |
| screens | `(dashboard)/ledger/page.tsx` (179 lines), `ledger/[id]/page.tsx` (440 lines, tabs Ledger · Claims · Terms, `:13`), `ledger/[id]/gaps/new/page.tsx` (231 lines) | shipped; raw `fetch().then(r => r.json())` at `page.tsx:50`, `[id]/page.tsx:94,107`, `gaps/new/page.tsx:56` |
| not built | statement import, evidence upload, claim notes writer, discount-term writer, the 219-gap migration | `docs/brand-ledger-flow.md` §5 |

The vendor detail page `src/app/(dashboard)/vendors/[id]/page.tsx` has six tabs
(`:148-155`, bar at `:296-309`) and no link to `/ledger/[id]`. Its own "Ledger" tab
(`:684-735`, fed by `GET /api/vendors/[id]/ledger`) is BCH's own bills-and-payments running
balance and stays as it is. The action-button row is `:202-218` (Call, WhatsApp).

### 2.3 Field-by-field: the app's document against the shipped tables

| App field | Shipped home | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| entry `date, type, ref, amount, dir, side, note` | `BrandLedgerEntry.entryDate, type, ref, amount, direction, side, note` | `type: note` (dir 0) has no enum value |
| entry `audit.s / audit.t / audit.g` | `auditStatus, auditNote, gapId` | `g` is a number; resolve to the gap's id by `(vendorId, number)` |
| entry `id` (`lu-0001`, `man-…`) | none | not needed; the import refuses a vendor that already has rows |
| gap `n, title, type, amt, amtText, status, tier, evidence, action, result` | `LedgerGap.number, title, gapType, amount, amountNote, status, tier, evidenceText, action, result` | none |
| gap `progress[{date,text}]` | `LedgerGapNote.body, createdAt` | `createdAt` must be set explicitly on import |
| evidence `{file, doc, date, source, note}` | `LedgerGapEvidence.url, kind, capturedOn, source, note` | `date` is free text ("2024-08 orders"); `capturedOn` is a DateTime |
| brand `sub, updated, lastReviewed, position, notes, theirBal, ourBal, recov, deadline, ledger{opening, coverage, matchable, note}` | **none** | a new 1:1 table |
| brand `id` → `CULT` code | `BRAND_CODE` map in code | a profile column |

### 2.4 Storage and AI, as they are on disk

- **Storage** is a provider resolved from the `StorageConfig` row — S3 via aws4fetch or the
  local filesystem — behind `src/lib/storage/index.ts` (`getStorage:94`, `tryGetStorage:126`).
  Contract `types.ts:27-57`: `put`, `delete`, `exists`, `publicUrl`, `keyFromUrl`, `presignPut`.
  **No `read` and no signed GET**; see Q1. Browser uploads are bound by
  `upload-policy.ts` (`ALLOWED_PREFIXES:10-22`, PDF only under `transfers/`, `:56-58`); a
  server-side `storage.put` bypasses it, which is how `purchase-orders/quotations/` works
  (`po-extraction/store.ts:193-216`). Delete pattern: `keyFromUrl` then `storage.delete`,
  warn-only (`store.ts:275-299`).
- **AI** is one entry point, `runAi` (`src/lib/ai/index.ts:171`), reading the active
  `AiProvider` row (`schema.prisma:1192-1210`; one row on local `bch`). `AiRequest`
  (`types.ts:21-53`) takes `prompt`, `system`, `attachments` (kind `pdf` | `image` only — **no
  text attachment**, `types.ts:12-19`), `maxTokens`, `json`, and — **uncommitted on disk** —
  `jsonSchema` and `effort` (`types.ts:39-52`, `index.ts:203-204, 233`). Retries `index.ts:41-42`;
  `max_tokens` and `refusal` throw (`:221-230`). Errors map to HTTP in `http.ts:9-36`.
- **The pattern to copy** is the untracked `src/lib/po-extraction/prompts.ts`: fixed system
  prompts, a JSON schema with `additionalProperties: false` and every key in `required`
  (`:74-79`), the user's free text sanitised (`sanitizeHint:28-46`, 200 chars, refuses
  "ignore/system/prompt/instruction") and inserted **as data inside a tag**, never as an
  instruction (`:144`).
- **Do not copy** `api/bank-statements/route.ts:109` — `text.slice(0, 50000)` silently drops
  the tail of a statement (audit finding F1, still open).
- `xlsx@0.18.5` is a direct dependency; CSV goes through it (`excel-parser.ts:90`). No zip
  library (Q2).

## 3. Implementation plan

Six parts, one commit each, in this order: **A** schema and RBAC → **B** API → **C** UI port →
**D** JSON import → **E** uploads and AI → **F** removal and docs. A–B are prerequisites for
everything; C, D and E are independent of each other once B exists and can be built by three
agents in parallel.

### Part A — schema and RBAC

**A.1 One additive migration**, folder `prisma/migrations/2026MMDDhhmmss_vendor_ledger_profile_uploads/`
(sorting after `20260909145100_po_sheet_extraction_and_line_name`), written by
`npx prisma migrate dev --name vendor_ledger_profile_uploads` against **localhost only**. The
owner applies it elsewhere by hand.

enum LedgerAiTask { STATEMENT_ROWS CLAIMS_FROM_CHAT CLAIMS_FROM_IMAGE }
enum LedgerAiRunStatus { RUNNING DONE FAILED ACCEPTED DISCARDED }
```

Plus, on existing models: `LedgerEntryType` gains `NOTE`; `LedgerGapEvidence` gains
`capturedLabel String?` (the app's free-text date); `Module` gains
`assignable Boolean @default(true)` (A.3); `Vendor` gains the three back-relations. Money
stays `Float` — the house convention (`docs/agents/database-architect.md` is consulted at
build time on this exact point; the schema already uses Float for every ledger amount).

Read the SQL before committing: every statement must be `ADD COLUMN`, `ADD VALUE` or
`CREATE TABLE`. Nothing drops.

**A.2 Catalog and seed.** `prisma/rbac-catalog.ts:465` `route: "/ledger"` → `route: null`
with a comment in the `bills` style; both ledger entries gain `assignable: false`.
`ModuleSeed` (`:25-47`) gains `assignable?: boolean`; `prisma/seed-rbac.ts:76-94` writes it in
both the update and the create. After deploy the owner runs `npm run db:seed:rbac`.

**A.3 Admin-only enforcement, as data.** In `src/app/api/roles/[id]/route.ts` between `:68`
and `:70`, and in `src/app/api/roles/route.ts` between `:44` and `:46`:

```ts
if (!role.isSystem) {
  const reserved = await prisma.permission.count({
    where: { id: { in: permissionIds }, module: { assignable: false } },
  });
  if (reserved > 0) return errorResponse("These permissions are reserved for the system role", 400);
}
```

`role.isSystem` is a column (`schema.prisma:87`); no role name is compared, so CLAUDE.md rules
1 and 2 hold. ADMIN keeps everything through `seed-rbac.ts:186-205`. `GET /api/modules`
(`route.ts:17-35`) returns `assignable`; `team/permissions/page.tsx` disables the module's
"Select all" (`:326`) and each action button (`:339`) when `!mod.assignable`, and shows an
"Admin only" badge beside the label (`:314`).

### Part B — API

Every route: `requireFeature`, zod, `successResponse`, a `createLogger("ledger:<area>")`
scope, `failure()` in every `catch`. The shipped routes are brought up to that bar in the same
commit (they have no logger today).

| # | Route | Guard | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| B.1 | `GET /api/ledger/vendors/[id]` | `brand_ledger.view` | Extended to return the **view shape** the screen needs (§C.2): profile, entries (with `gapNumber` resolved), gaps with notes and evidence, plus everything it returns today. Opening balance now comes from `profile.ledgerOpeningAmount` (Q7). |
| B.2 | `PUT /api/ledger/vendors/[id]/profile` | `brand_ledger.edit` | Balances editor (`theirBal*`, `ourBal*`) and the Reviewed button (`lastReviewed`). One schema, partial. |
| B.3 | `POST /api/ledger/vendors/[id]/gaps` | `brand_ledger_gaps.create` | Exists; now also creates the `Added` note, and accepts `amountNote`/`evidenceText`/`action` exactly as the form sends them. |
| B.4 | `PUT /api/ledger/gaps/[id]` | `brand_ledger_gaps.edit`, `approve` for RESOLVED/REJECTED (`gaps/[id]/route.ts:31`, kept) | Exists; when the status becomes RESOLVED, appends the `Marked resolved` note in the same transaction. |
| B.5 | `POST /api/ledger/gaps/[id]/notes` | `brand_ledger_gaps.edit` | New — the progress note. `LedgerGapNote` has had no writer. |
| B.6 | `DELETE /api/ledger/vendors/[id]/entries?entryId=` | `brand_ledger.delete` | Exists; refuses non-MANUAL rows with the existing message. The screen routes an imported row's × to `PUT /api/ledger/entries/[id]/review { matchStatus: "IGNORED" }` instead (D3). |
| B.7 | `POST /api/ledger/vendors/[id]/entries` | `brand_ledger.create` | Exists; `ledgerEntrySchema` gains `NOTE`, and `amount` becomes nullable **only** when `type === NOTE` (the app's rule, `App.jsx:823`). |
| B.8 | `POST /api/ledger/gaps/[id]/evidence`, `DELETE /api/ledger/evidence/[id]` | `brand_ledger_gaps.edit` | New — multipart upload to `ledger/<vendorId>/evidence/`, row in `LedgerGapEvidence`; delete removes the object then the row. |
| B.9 | ~~gated file route~~ | — | **Dropped by Q1.** Files are opened by their stored public URL (`LocalProvider` issues `/api/media/<key>`, which already requires a session; S3 issues the bucket URL). |
| B.10 | `DELETE /api/ledger/vendors` (list route) | — | **Deleted** with its page (D1). Its only callers were the three screens (`ledger/page.tsx:50`, `[id]/page.tsx:94`, `gaps/new/page.tsx:56`). |

Deleting a gap: the app deletes after a confirm (`App.jsx:385-396`); the shipped route refuses
when evidence or linked rows exist (`gaps/[id]/route.ts:80-84`). Keep the refusal and show its
message — the same principle as D3.

### Part C — the UI port, 100 %

**C.1 Files.** `src/app/(dashboard)/ledger/[id]/page.tsx` is rewritten as a thin shell that
fetches B.1 with `apiFetch` and renders `<BrandPage>`; `gaps/new/page.tsx` is deleted (the
app's gap form is inline). New directory `src/app/(dashboard)/ledger/[id]/_components/`, one
file per component of the tree, each `"use client"`, each a line-for-line TypeScript port:

| Component | From `App.jsx` | Writes (→ route) |
|---|---|---|
| `brand-page.tsx` | `:223-282` | Reviewed → B.2 |
| `collapsible.tsx` | `:284-294` | — |
| `gaps-tab.tsx` | `:298-429` | add/edit → B.3/B.4 · status → B.4 · note → B.5 · delete → existing DELETE · share → `wa.me` |
| `progress-note.tsx`, `gap-form.tsx` | `:431-444`, `:446-487` | via parent |
| `ledger-tab.tsx` | `:496-694` | add entry → B.7 · × → B.6 or review IGNORED (D3) |
| `entry-explain.tsx`, `evidence.tsx`, `gap-shots.tsx`, `entry-form.tsx`, `balance-editor.tsx` | `:697-722`, `:726-759`, `:762-793`, `:802-831`, `:833-874` | balances → B.2 |
| `monthly-tab.tsx`, `table-tab.tsx`, `share-tab.tsx` | `:881-991`, `:998-1168`, `:1172-1218` | — (CSV, clipboard) |
| `ledger-helpers.ts` | `store.js:67-168` (`today, daysSince, fmtINR, fmtLakh, gapAmount, entryDir, entrySide, computeThread, openGaps, csvEscape, downloadCSV, brandSummaryText`, the constant lists) and `App.jsx:11-39, 491-494, 795-800` | — |

`GapShots` reads `gap.evidence[]` from the API instead of `EVIDENCE[brand.id][n]`, and its
`src` is the stored `url` (Q1). `‹ Back` (`App.jsx:233`) goes to `/vendors/[id]`. Nothing else in the
tree touches routing (`useHashRoute` and the `#/brand/` match live outside it).

**C.2 The view shape** is the app's `brand` object, so the ported components read the same
property names (`id, name, sub, updated, lastReviewed, position, notes, theirBal, ourBal,
recov, deadline, ledger, entries[], gaps[]`) and B.1 maps rows into it server-side: enum
values lowered and hyphenated (`CREDIT_NOTE` → `credit-note`), `direction` → `dir`, `side`
lowered, `auditStatus/auditNote/gapNumber` → `audit{s,t,g}`, `number` → `n`, `amount` → `amt`,
`amountNote` → `amtText`, `evidenceText` → `evidence`, notes → `progress[{date,text}]`. Mapping
on the server keeps the components a verbatim port.

**C.3 The stylesheet.** `styles.css` (381 lines) is copied to
`src/app/(dashboard)/ledger/[id]/ledger.css` and scoped: `:root` tokens, `* {box-sizing}`,
`html, body` and `body` rules (`styles.css:1-27`) become `.bch-ledger` / `.bch-ledger *`;
`#root` (`:28`, and in the `@media` blocks `:335-376`) becomes `.bch-ledger`, keeping the
720 px / 1200 px / 1320 px widths and the safe-area padding. The Dashboard-only groups
(`.summary`, `.brandcard`, `.brandgrid`, `.pingate*`, `.syncdot`, `.sectiontitle`,
`.alert.warn`, the legacy `.entry` rules at `:143-148`) are dropped. Tailwind v4's preflight
is the one thing that can still shift a pixel; the verification in §4 compares both apps side
by side, tab by tab.

**C.4 The vendor page.** In `vendors/[id]/page.tsx:202-218`, a third button beside Call and
WhatsApp — `Ledger`, `variant="outline"`, `BookOpen` icon, `href={/ledger/${id}}` — rendered
only when `canView("brand_ledger")` (cosmetic; the API re-checks). The page's own Ledger tab
is untouched.

**C.5 Permissions on the screen.** `canEdit("brand_ledger")` hides add/delete/balances/
Reviewed; `canEdit("brand_ledger_gaps")` hides the gap form, status row, note box and delete;
resolved/rejected buttons additionally need `canApprove("brand_ledger_gaps")`. Share, CSV and
the WhatsApp button are read-only actions and stay for anyone who can view.

### Part D — the one-time JSON import (R8, R9)

- `POST /api/ledger/vendors/[id]/import-json` — `brand_ledger.create` **and**
  `brand_ledger_gaps.create`; multipart, one `.json` file ≤ 5 MB, plus `brandId` (the app's
  brand id inside the file). Validated with `validateImport`'s rules (`store.js:57-65`) as a
  zod schema.
- Refuses when the vendor already has any `BrandLedgerEntry`, `LedgerGap` or profile row —
  the import is idempotent by refusal, not by upsert.
- One transaction: profile (§2.3 mapping, `code` from Q8), entries (type map incl. `note`,
  `source: STATEMENT_CSV` for `lu-`/`cu-`/`em-`/`ao-`/`ra-`/`ho-`/`tr-` ids and `MANUAL` for
  `man-` ids, so D3 treats hand-added rows correctly), gaps, notes (`createdAt` = the note's
  date, `authorId` = the importer), then a second pass linking `audit.g` → `gapId`.
- Counts returned and shown: brands in file, entries and gaps written, notes written, gaps
  whose `audit.g` pointed at a missing number (expected 0).
- UI: on the ledger screen, an **Import JSON** card visible only while the vendor has no rows
  and only to `brand_ledger.create`; file picker restricted to `application/json`; a select of
  the brands found in the file; a confirm listing the counts before writing. The upload is
  **not** stored in S3 — the file is the owner's export and stays on the device.
- Removal afterwards: the card and the route are behind one constant
  `LEDGER_JSON_IMPORT_ENABLED` in `src/lib/brand-ledger/import-json.ts`; flipping it removes
  the card and makes the route return 410. Deleting the files is a later, one-line cleanup.

### Part E — uploads, S3, AI (R10–R12)

**E.1 Upload.** (`fflate` becomes a direct dependency for `.zip`, Q2.) `POST /api/ledger/vendors/[id]/uploads` — `brand_ledger.create`; multipart
`file` + `kind`; ≤ 100 MB (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`); accepted types by kind: STATEMENT pdf/xlsx/
xls/csv, CHAT txt/zip, SCREENSHOT png/jpg/jpeg/webp, DOCUMENT pdf/png/jpg. Server-side
`getStorage().put` under `ledger/<vendorId>/<kind>/` (a new prefix `ledger/` is added to
`ALLOWED_PREFIXES` and `PREFIX_TYPES` so a later presigned path stays consistent). Storage is
checked **before** any AI spend, as `purchase-orders/extract/route.ts:88-91` does. Row in
`LedgerUpload`.

**E.2 The Files card** on the ledger screen (a sixth card below the tabs, not a sixth tab —
the tab bar stays the app's five): each upload with name, size, kind, date, the runs it fed,
**Run AI**, **Delete file**. This card is the only addition to the app's screen, and it exists
because R10–R12 have no counterpart in the app.

**E.3 Run AI.** `POST /api/ledger/uploads/[id]/run` — `brand_ledger.create` for
`STATEMENT_ROWS`, `brand_ledger_gaps.create` for the claim tasks; body `{ task, prompt? }`.
`prompt` goes through a `sanitizeHint`-style filter (500 chars, same refusal list as
`po-extraction/prompts.ts:21`) and is inserted as data inside `<instructions>`; the system
prompt and JSON schema are fixed per task in `src/lib/brand-ledger/ai-prompts.ts`.
`maxDuration = 60` on the route.

| Task | Input | Output schema | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STATEMENT_ROWS` | PDF → `runAi` with a `pdf` attachment; XLSX/CSV → **no AI**, `xlsx` grid → `classifyEntry`/`parseLedgerDate` (`reconcile.ts:24, 64`) | `{ statementDate, periodFrom, periodTo, claimedClosing, rows: [{date, label, ref, debit, credit, note}] }` | `checkBalance` (`reconcile.ts:122`) against `claimedClosing`; the run stores `tiesOut` and the difference in `proposals` |
| `CLAIMS_FROM_CHAT` | `.txt` (or `_chat.txt` from the zip, Q2) split into chunks (Q6), each chunk inlined in the prompt as data | per chunk `{ claims: [{title, type, amount, amountNote, promisedBy, promisedOn, quote, line}] }` | merged into one proposal list |
| `CLAIMS_FROM_IMAGE` | `image` attachment | same claim schema | — |

`jsonSchema` and `effort` are used **only after** the PO-sheet commit lands (Q9); until then
`json: true` with the shape described in the prompt, which is what OpenAI needs anyway
(`openai.ts:142-145`).

**E.4 Review and accept.** The run's proposals render in a review card: statement rows as a
table with the tie-out line at the top (a mismatch is shown in red and **blocks Accept** until
a person edits the claimed closing or a row); claims as gap cards with the quoted message.
`POST /api/ledger/runs/[id]/accept` writes, in one transaction: for a statement, a
`BrandStatement` (`fileUrl` = the upload, `extractionModel`, `sourceKind`) and its
`BrandLedgerEntry` rows (`source: STATEMENT_PDF|XLSX|CSV`, `matchStatus: UNMATCHED`); for
claims, `LedgerGap` rows with the next numbers, `status: VERIFY`, `evidenceText` = the quote,
and a note `From AI run <id>`. `POST …/discard` marks the run DISCARDED. Nothing is ever
written to `VendorBill`/`VendorPayment`/`VendorCredit` (the schema's own rule,
`schema.prisma:2465-2483`).

**E.5 Delete file (R12).** `DELETE /api/ledger/uploads/[id]` — `brand_ledger.delete`;
`keyFromUrl` → `storage.delete` (the `po-extraction/store.ts:275-299` pattern, but an S3
failure here **returns 502** rather than warn-only, because the owner asked for the delete
and must know it did not happen); then `fileUrl = null`, `deletedAt = now()`. Runs and their
proposals survive. A confirm names the file and says whether a run has been accepted from it.

### Part F — removal and docs

- Delete `src/app/(dashboard)/ledger/page.tsx`, `ledger/[id]/gaps/new/page.tsx`,
  `src/app/api/ledger/vendors/route.ts`.
- `docs/implementation/pending/ledger-merge-plan.md`: add a status line "§7 and §12 Frontend
  superseded 9 Sep 2026 by `0909-vendor-ledger-screens-and-ai-import-plan.md`; the schema,
  engine and API decisions stand". `docs/implementation/README.md:147` row updated.
- `docs/brand-ledger-flow.md` gets a dated note pointing here for the screen and the import.

### Phases and dependencies

| # | Part | Depends on | Size | Parallel? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A schema + RBAC | Q9 | small | — |
| 2 | B API | 1 | medium | — |
| 3 | C UI port | 2 | **large** | with 4 and 5 |
| 4 | D JSON import | 2 | medium | with 3 and 5 |
| 5 | E uploads + AI | 2 | large | with 3 and 4 |
| 6 | F removal + docs | 3 | small | — |
| 7 | Verification (§4) | all | medium | — |

### Logging

Scopes: `ledger:view`, `ledger:profile`, `ledger:gaps`, `ledger:entries`, `ledger:evidence`,
`ledger:import-json`, `ledger:uploads`, `ledger:ai`, `ledger:files`. `debug` for every AI
request (purpose, upload id, bytes, chunk index) and every storage call (key only);
`info` for import finished (counts), run finished (usage, tiesOut), accept (rows written),
file deleted; `warn` for a refused prompt, an unlinked `audit.g`, a run over the size limit;
`error` for a failed run, a failed S3 delete. Never the prompt text, never a URL with a
signature, never the API key (the logger's `SECRET_KEY` redaction covers `key`/`token`, so AI
context objects use `provider`/`model`, as `src/lib/ai/index.ts:50` does).

### Board of agents — checked at build time, before "done"

- **accounting-consultant**: the module never writes bills, payments or credits; Zoho stays
  the source of truth for financials; an AI-read figure reaches a table only after a person
  accepts it and only when the statement ties out.
- **database-architect**: one additive migration; `Float` money matches every existing ledger
  column; Json only for `reply`/`proposals`; indexes on `(vendorId, createdAt)`.
- **backend-engineer**: `requireFeature` on every route, zod on every body, `failure()` in
  every catch, `maxDuration` on the AI route, no `res.json()` on third-party responses.
- **frontend-engineer**: `apiFetch`/`apiTry` only; loading, empty and error states on the
  shell, the Files card and the review card; every stateful component `"use client"`.
- **integration-architect**: files stored before AI spend; delete verified, not assumed;
  no attachment or prompt sent without a size check (`runAi` has none).

## 4. Verification

1. `npx prisma migrate dev --name vendor_ledger_profile_uploads` on localhost; read the SQL;
   `npm run db:seed:rbac`; `/team/permissions` shows both ledger modules greyed with
   "Admin only" for a non-system role, and `PUT /api/roles/<non-system>` with a reserved
   permission id returns 400.
2. `npm run build` — the owner runs it (21–45 minutes); exit code reported, not an impression.
3. `/vendors/<AOKI id>` shows the Ledger button; a user without `brand_ledger.view` does not
   see it and gets 403 from `/api/ledger/vendors/<id>`.
4. Import JSON for aoki with the owner's export: counts reconcile with the file (aoki: 48
   entries, 18 gaps); the card disappears afterwards; a second import returns the refusal.
5. Side-by-side with the ledger app at `#/brand/aoki`, tab by tab: header, balances card,
   Ledger (thread, matchbar figure, audit bar, filters, search, show-earlier), Monthly (rows
   and totals), Table (ladder and totals), Gaps (filters, expand, status row, note, share),
   Share (text identical). Computed closing equals the app's to the rupee.
6. Actions: Reviewed flips the chip; add entry appears in the thread with the right sign;
   × on a `man-` row deletes after confirm, × on a `lu-` row marks it ignored and the row
   greys; add/edit/delete gap; status change to resolved writes the "Marked resolved" note
   and is refused without `approve`; balances editor persists after reload.
7. Upload a Lucifer statement PDF; Run AI → the review shows rows and the tie-out; force a
   mismatch by editing the claimed closing → Accept is blocked; restore → Accept writes a
   `BrandStatement` with `tiesOut = true` and rows appear in the Ledger tab as `statement`
   entries. Upload the aoki `_chat.txt` with the prompt "discounts promised by Prashant" → the
   claims review lists candidates with quotes; Accept creates VERIFY gaps numbered after the
   existing 18.
8. Delete file → the object is gone from the bucket (check in the S3 console), the row shows
   "deleted", the run's proposals still open, and the old URL now returns the bucket's 404.
9. `LOG_LEVEL=0` shows the debug lines from §3 Logging; no prompt text, no key.

## 6. Build record — 9 Sep 2026

Built the same day, once the owner named the branch: Part A first (schema, migration, catalog,
seed, the two role-write routes, the permissions screen), then B–E by four agents in parallel
with file ownership (B the API, C the UI port, D the JSON import, E uploads and AI), then F.
`npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0 — its only output is stale entries under `.next/types/` for the two
deleted pages, which a build regenerates; `eslint` clean on every touched file. **`npm run build`
was NOT run** — the owner runs it. **Nothing is committed**: HEAD is still `39dfb81`, the
branch's base; everything below is in the working tree.

**Branch.** `feat/0909-vendor-ledger-screens`, cut from `feat/0909-stock-po-expense` @ `39dfb81`.

**Migration.** `prisma/migrations/20260909162948_vendor_ledger_profile_uploads/migration.sql` —
written by `migrate dev` on localhost `bch`, applied there and nowhere else. Read in full:

| Statement | Count | What |
|---|---|---|
| `CREATE TYPE` | 3 | `LedgerUploadKind`, `LedgerAiTask`, `LedgerAiRunStatus` |
| `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE` | 1 | `LedgerEntryType.NOTE` |
| `ADD COLUMN` | 2 | `ledger_gap_evidence.capturedLabel`, `modules.assignable … DEFAULT true` |
| `CREATE TABLE` | 3 | `vendor_ledger_profiles`, `ledger_uploads`, `ledger_ai_runs` |
| `CREATE INDEX` | 3 | `(vendorId, createdAt)` twice, `ledger_ai_runs(uploadId)` |
| `ADD CONSTRAINT … FOREIGN KEY` | 6 | vendor, user and upload relations |

Nothing drops, nothing alters a column type, nothing sets `NOT NULL` on a populated table.
`migrate status` up to date on local `bch` afterwards.

**Files.** From `git status --short` on 9 Sep 2026: 26 tracked files changed (+565 / −1,171)
and 39 new files (5,911 lines).

Untracked and **not part of the change**: `.storage/` — the Local storage provider's directory
(`DEFAULT_LOCAL_DIR`, `src/lib/storage/local.ts:17`), holding two leftover objects from the pass.
It is not in `.gitignore`. It must not be committed: delete it or ignore it.

| Gaps (B.3–B.5) | `POST …/gaps`, notes, `PUT` and `DELETE /api/ledger/gaps/[id]` | #19 created with the "Added" note; a progress note; resolved → the "Marked resolved" note; deleted |
| Uploads (E.1, E.5) | a CSV statement to TRINITY CYCLES | stored; `STATEMENT_ROWS` ran with no AI → proposals with the tie-out; accept refused (409) while it did not tie; delete → object gone from `.storage/`; run after delete → 410 |
| AI (E.3) | a chat upload → `CLAIMS_FROM_CHAT` | read, chunked, sent; Anthropic refused with `Your credit balance is too low` — the code path worked, the provider did not |
| Evidence (B.8) | `POST /api/ledger/gaps/[id]/evidence` on gap 1 | row with `capturedLabel = "2024-08 orders"`, shown in the view; delete-gap-with-evidence 409; `DELETE /api/ledger/evidence/[id]` OK |

**Two bugs found on the way, fixed before this record:**

1. `src/lib/validations.ts` — `ledgerEntryWriteSchema.date` had lost the backslashes of its
   regex (`^d{4}-d{2}-d{2}$` where `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` was meant), so every add-entry from the
   screen was refused with "Date must be YYYY-MM-DD". Found by the first `POST …/entries`.
2. `src/lib/brand-ledger/ai-run.ts` `statementFromSheet` — the sheet reader now opens the
   workbook with `cellDates: true` and reads the grid with `raw: true`, so a date cell arrives
   as a Date (read back with the local getters) and an amount as a number rather than formatted
   text; and an opening or closing line's figure is taken as a **magnitude** (`Math.abs`)
   whichever column it sits in. Found by the Trinity CSV run, whose tie-out read the wrong figures.

**Built as planned, with these deviations and additions:**

| Where | What differs from §3, and why |
|---|---|
| A.1 | `LedgerUploadKind` has no `JSON_EXPORT` — the import file is read once and never stored (Part D), so the value would name nothing. `LedgerAiRun` gains `chunks Int @default(1)` (how many pieces a chat export was sent in), and `provider` / `model` are nullable because a sheet run has no AI. |
| B.1 | The view also carries `code`, `source` and `ignored` per entry, `shots` per gap, `canSeeGaps` and `isEmpty` (the import card's condition). Without `brand_ledger_gaps.view` the view returns `gaps: []` and the entries keep only the gap number. |
| B.6 / D3 | The × on an imported row keeps the app's "Delete …?" confirm; the outcome is IGNORED. The row stays visible, dimmed, with an `ignored` chip, and leaves the balance, Monthly and Table. |
| B.8 | `DELETE /api/ledger/evidence/[id]` exists and was verified by curl, but **the screen has no button for it** — `GapShots` is the app's component and the app had no delete there. The owner decides whether one is wanted. The free-text date is stored in `capturedLabel`; when it parses as a date, `capturedOn` is set too. |
| B.9 | Dropped, as Q1 decided. Local files open through `/api/media/<key>` (session required); S3 files through the bucket URL. |
| C.4 | The header shows `Vendor.name` (AOKI MOBILITY), not the export's brand name (Aoki); `‹ Back` goes to `/vendors/[id]`; CSV file names carry the vendor id. |
| D | The card preselects the brand whose id appears in the vendor's name, else the first brand; it renders only while `isEmpty` (no entries, no gaps, no profile). File cap 5 MB. `LEDGER_JSON_IMPORT_ENABLED` lives at `src/lib/brand-ledger/import-json.ts:38`. |
| E.1 | A DOCUMENT or SCREENSHOT upload may run either `CLAIMS_FROM_IMAGE` or `STATEMENT_ROWS`; the task select offers both. Caps: upload 100 MB, AI attachment 30 MB. |
| E.3 | Prompt cap 500 characters (`USER_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS`); refused on ignore / override / system prompt / jailbreak / developer message, **before** a run row is created. `maxDuration = 60`. Chat chunks of 1,500 messages (`CHAT_CHUNK_MESSAGES`). |
| E.4 | Tie tolerance ₹1 (`reconcile.ts:102`, mirrored in the review card). Accept re-runs the check server-side and answers 409 with the difference; the review card lets the person edit the opening as well as the claimed closing. |
| E.5 | A storage delete that fails answers **502** and leaves the row live; a URL the live provider never issued deletes the row and leaves the object, with a warn line. |
| AI errors | A provider refusal reaches the screen as the `src/lib/ai/http.ts` sentence (Anthropic's 400 → 502 "AI processing failed. Please try again.") while the run row keeps the provider's own message. |

**Owner steps still owed**, in this order:

1. `.env` — every `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` line is commented out at the moment (2–3 the
   cloud TEST project, 9–10 the other Supabase project, 13–14 localhost) and **line 13 spells the
   user `pstgres`**. Fix the typo and uncomment 13–14 (or export both in the shell) before
   anything below — the build needs a reachable database.
2. `npm run build` — 21–45 minutes, background it, report the exit code.
3. The browser walk: `docs/manual-testing/0909-vendor-ledger-verification.md` (13 sections,
   84 cases).
4. The cloud test database (`nfemnakgiahcxbnmknjg`), by hand: `npx prisma migrate status`, then
   `npx prisma migrate deploy` with `DIRECT_URL` on 5432, then `npm run db:seed:rbac`.
5. Anthropic credit — the account has none; Settings → AI → Test and every PDF, chat and image
   task fail until it is topped up. A sheet statement needs no AI.
6. Create the Tata Stryder vendor, import the eight brands, attach the five Cultsport evidence
   files by hand (walk §13.2), then flip `LEDGER_JSON_IMPORT_ENABLED` to false.
7. `.storage/` — delete it or add it to `.gitignore`; it must not be committed.
8. Commit — nothing on this branch is committed yet. Claude commits only when asked.

## 5. Out of scope, deliberately

- The Vercel Blob state and the `sync.js` mechanism — not read, not migrated (D6).
- The WhatsApp zips, `findings.md`, `reconciliation.md`, `open-items-register.md` — research
  inputs, not application data; they may be uploaded as CHAT/DOCUMENT files if wanted.
- Per-invoice discount **computation** from `VendorDiscountTerm` and its editor — the app
  shows hand-typed audit verdicts, and those are what the port shows.
- Matching statement rows to BCH bills/payments in the screen — the engine still runs and the
  API still returns `match`, but the app's UI has no place for it and the UI is the app's.
- The `/accounts/vendor-ledger` screen and the vendor page's own Ledger tab — a different
  ledger (`docs/brand-ledger-flow.md` §0), untouched.
- Removing `LedgerEntrySource.BCH_BOOKS` (declared, unused) — a later cleanup.
- AI spend logging to a table (audit F9) — belongs to
  `ai-provider-config-and-task-routing-plan.md`; this plan records usage on `LedgerAiRun`
  only for its own runs.
- Production deployment, `migrate deploy` and `db:seed:rbac` on the cloud test database —
  the owner's, by hand.
