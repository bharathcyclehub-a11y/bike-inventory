# Priority build & stock flow — units in sync, outward guard, ★ priority, approvals, hold, sidebar, dashboard

Status: completed — 21 Sep 2026, all four phases (units in sync, outward guard, ★ priority, approvals, hold, sidebar, dashboard, bins, categories, Google Contacts) merged to main in PR #52; parts later superseded by plan 2109 (Generate codes, Unmatched tab and per-rule Apply removed; inbound left /approvals); the browser walk and Google Cloud setup are still the owner's.
Branch: **`feat/1709-priority-build-stock-flow`**, off `main` `861a237`. Requirements committed there
as `dcdb594`.

### 0.2 Restated — the requirements, as narrowed by the owner's answers

The numbering is the requirements doc's. Where an answer changed a requirement, the change is
stated in the row.

| # | Requirement (after answers) | Answers | Part |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Each `/assembly` tab has its own address `?tab=awaiting` / `tasks` / `mine` / `labels`; switching updates it (replace, not push). | Q1, Q26 | E |
| R2 | A `?tab=` the user may not see falls back to one they can. | — | E |
| R3 | Hold offers exactly **ISSUE WITH THE CYCLE** and **ISSUE ON THE WORKFLOOR**; the six reasons and free text go. | — | E |
| R4 | One tap holds. No confirm, no undo bar; a mis-tap is fixed by **Resume**. | Q4 | E |
| R5 | The timer freezes on hold and shows the frozen value after a reload. | defect 1 | E |
| R6 | The chosen issue is stored against the build. Mechanic adds nothing; a supervisor may add a note. | Q3 | E |
| R7 | Every unit carries a condition (assembled / unassembled) per model and location, and **unit records stay in sync with stock** on every transfer, sale, correction and audit. The app picks units (assembled first, then oldest); a person can swap. | Q33, Q41 | B |
| R8 | The build line lists **all** unassembled units; no page limit may hide a unit from selection. ~~Every inbound item needs assembling — no category filter.~~ **Superseded by R42** (17 Sep, later): units in a non-assemblable bin are left out. | Q34, Q44, R42 | E |
| R9 | Awaiting: multi-select + bulk assign; filter model / brand / location / bin; sort delivery day / received date / model; ★ first. | Q20 | E |
| R10 | Assembled units show in Stock & inventory. | — | F |
| R11 | A page shows assembled vs unassembled per model per location. No "not tracked" column: stock is **reset and re-audited at unit level**, one warehouse at a time — the audit records assembled qty + unassembled qty; the reset clears counts **and** units. | Q13, Q42, Q43 | B, F |
| R12 | Place of supply = the outward's matched **FLOOR** warehouse. "The warehouse" = a **GODOWN of the same store**. | Q7 | C |
| R13 | Scheduling is never blocked (A26/A37 stand). A short floor shows a warning naming the godown quantity. The **hard block** is at `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` (new, single and batch), `WALK_OUT` and `DELIVERED`, and names where the stock is. Quantity only, not condition. | Q31, Q10, Q11 | C |
| R14 | The shortage **notifies every user holding `transfers.create`** (except the actor). | Q31, Q14 | C |
| R15 | The transfer is `GODOWN_TO_FLOOR` with **one** document, raised and approved as today. | Q7, Q38 | D |
| R16 | Starring a short outward **picks and reserves** units in that store's godown; unassembled ones appear ★ on Awaiting **at once**, before the transfer is approved. | Q35, Q12 | C |
| R17 | Once received, the floor holds the units; the outward's check passes. | — | B, C |
| R18 | **Day only** — no delivery time. The customer picks the day as today; slot rules unchanged. | Q32, Q40 | — |
| R19 | ★ is set and cleared by users holding the **new `delivery_priority.edit`** grant. | Q21 | C |
| R20 | ★ jobs first on Awaiting, Tasks and My Build Queue, ordered by delivery day then star time; cards show the delivery day. No ★ tab. | Q2, Q20 | E |
| R21 | ★ can be removed any time; a build in progress carries on; reserved units are released; every set/clear is logged. | Q21 | C |
| R22 | Inbound, Outbound, Transfer and Stock audit each have a doer and an approver — **by role permission only** (`create`/`edit` = doer, `approve` = approver). No named people. | Q14 | D |
| R23 | Anyone whose role holds `approve` may approve, **including their own record**. The stock-audit self-block is removed; transfer auto-approve stays. | Q15 | D |
| R24 | A request pushes to every holder of the `approve` grant (except the requester). Android/desktop notifications carry **Approve · Reject · Open**; iPhone opens. | Q14, Q19 | D |
| R25 | Reject sends the record back as **returned**, with a note; the creator fixes it and resubmits the **same record**. Transfers and inbound (inbound Reject is new). | Q17, Q36 | D |
| R26 | Every approval event is recorded. An approver error = a correction within N days (default 7) of an approved inbound/transfer, a short receive, or a reversal; customer flags recorded but not counted. Rule and N are settings. | Q18 | D |
| R26a | **Outbound approval** before `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` / `SHIPPED` via `deliveries.approve`; walk-outs need none. Dummy deliveries are excluded from the guard, ★, push and approval. | Q16, Q37 | C |
| R27 | Operations = **Build line assembly** (top) then **Stock management**. | — | F |
| R28 | Stock management expands only (no link); holds **Stock & inventory**, a divider, then 1 Inbound · 2 Outbound · 3 Stock transfer · 4 Stock audit. `/stock-management` stays reachable by URL. | Q23, Q27 | F |
| R29 | Barcode & labels = the **Labels** tab on `/assembly`. | Q26 | E, F |
| R30 | POS & settlement moves to Accounts. | — | F |
| R31 | New **Sales** group: Customers · Customer complaints · Second-Hand Cycles. | Q25 | F |
| R32 | **Admin › Settings › Store management**, one screen with tabs Stores · Warehouses · Bins. Module keys kept. | Q24 | F |
| R33 | Categories and Brands leave the menu and appear as chips inside Stock & inventory. | — | F |
| R34 | Mobile bottom bar stays per-user pins; no code. | Q28 | — |
| R35–R37 | **One** dashboard replaces the six variants; each card shows only if the viewer's role holds its grant; rows Money · Stuck · In progress · Done today · Stock by condition. Stuck = approvals > 24 h, inbound > 72 h, holds > 24 h, short outwards immediately; hours are settings. | Q29, Q30 | G |

**Added 17 Sep 2026 (later)** — the owner's additional requirements above:

| # | Requirement | Part |
|---|---|---|
| R38 | An outward reduces stock at **floor** level **and at bin level**: the bins the sold cycles sat in go down too. | H |
| R39 | A **home-bin rule** is set as **brand · category · subcategory (optional) · bin**, per warehouse. | H |
| R40 | When a rule is saved, a button **applies it to existing stock** — not only to future inbound items. | H |
| R41 | A button **generates unit codes (`U-000001`…) for existing items that are in bins**, not only for inbound items. | H |
| R42 | **Not every item needs assembly.** A **bin** can be marked **non-assemblable**; items stored there never appear in the unassembled listing. `/stock` can filter them, and `/assembly` has a **separate tab** listing them. *(Supersedes Q44 "every inbound item needs assembling".)* | H |
| R43 | Categories have **parent and child**, the child's parent **as in Zoho**. `/categories` shows the tree; the `/stock` category filter shows a parent's children. | I |
| R44 | **Save contact** on an outward also **saves the contact to the phone**. | C |
| R45 | On an outward whose stock is **not on its floor and cannot be reserved**, a **Find stock** button searches every warehouse (floors and godowns) and lists where the product is; the person **picks the source**, and the app **creates a transfer request** from there to the outward's floor. Users holding the approve permission **see the request on the dashboard or in a notification section**, approve it, and it moves through statuses (approved → pending dispatch → completed). **On completion, stock is reduced/added at every level** — warehouse, bin and unit. | C, D |
| R46 | Generated codes use the **same `U-000086` format** as the Awaiting screen; **every item gets its own separate code**, never shared, and each is **printed on a label** that is pasted on the physical product. | H |
| R47 | The category import saves **parent and child exactly as in Zoho**, and **products are linked to their category as in Zoho** too, so filtering by a category (parent or child) returns the same products Zoho would. The owner will **clear the categories and import again**. | I |

## 1. Questions and clarifications — raised by the code while planning

All 41 requirement questions are answered in the requirements doc. P1–P5 came up while
mapping the code for §3; P6–P14 came with the additional requirements R38–R44, P15–P19 with R45. Each changes the
build; each has a recommended default. Asked one at a time, in order.

| # | Question | Why it changes the build | Options | Recommended default | **Answer** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **Inbound receive in bin mode writes no `StockLevel`.** It updates `Product.currentStock` and `BinStock` only (`api/inbound/[id]/route.ts:265-284`), while no-bin mode calls `adjustWarehouseQty` (:286-301). Units are created either way (:312-324). Fix it here? | R7 needs per-warehouse quantity and units to agree. In bin mode the warehouse count stays 0 while units exist there, so the outward guard (per floor `StockLevel`) and the condition page disagree from the first receive. | (a) bin mode also writes `StockLevel` into the bin's warehouse; (b) leave it | (a) — it is the same root cause R7 exists to fix | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P2** | **Deleting an inbound shipment leaves its units** (`api/inbound/[id]/route.ts:511-528` reverses stock with `deductAnywhere`, units untouched). | Orphan units stay "unassembled" on Awaiting for stock that no longer exists. | (a) the shipment's unsold units are retired with it; (b) leave | (a) | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P3** | **What "clear the unit records" means on reset (Q43).** A unit may already have assembly tasks, bin movements and transfer rows pointing at it. | Hard-deleting rows breaks that history (or cascades it away). | (a) mark them with a new status **`RESET`** (cleared by a stock reset) and close their open assembly tasks as `CANCELLED`; (b) delete the rows | (a) — history stays readable, and "reset" is distinguishable from "lost" in the error metrics | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P4** | **Two older stock paths.** `api/inventory/inwards/verify` adds quantity with no units (:50-52); `api/inventory/cleanup` reverses inwards/outwards **outside a transaction** (:37-39). | Either one breaks R7's sync if it is still used. | (a) inwards/verify creates unassembled units; cleanup is left alone and listed as a known gap; (b) both kept in sync; (c) leave both | (a) — cleanup is a maintenance route with no transaction; fixing it properly is its own piece of work | **(b), with the owner's rules** 17 Sep — see 1.1 |
| **P5** | **The divider inside Stock management (Q23).** The sidebar has no divider support (`app-sidebar.tsx:345-365`), and the menu is data. | A divider needs a signal that is data, not a hardcoded module key. | (a) new column `Module.dividerBefore Boolean @default(false)`, set by the catalog on `inbound`; (b) no divider, only ordering | (a) — one additive column, no module key in code | **(a)** 17 Sep |

#### Questions on the additional requirements (R38–R44)

Facts behind them are in §2.5.

| # | Question | Why it changes the build | Options | Recommended default | **Answer** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P6** | **Non-assemblable at bin level (R42): what decides it for a unit?** A unit's assemblability would follow the bin it sits in *now*. | A cycle moved from a non-assemblable bin into a normal one would start showing on Awaiting, and a unit with **no bin** (bin tracking off, or not yet put away) has no flag at all. | (a) **bin flag only**, as the owner proposed: `Bin.nonAssemblable`; a unit counts as non-assemblable while its bin has the flag; no bin = assemblable; (b) bin flag **plus** a category flag, so spares are also caught before put-away; (c) a flag on the **unit**, set when it is put away into a flagged bin and kept after moves | (a) — exactly the owner's model, one column, and put-away already puts inbound items in their home bin | **Owner's rule** 17 Sep — see 1.1 |
| **P6a** | Can a bin's **non-assemblable** flag be **changed after the bin is created**? | Changing it on a bin that holds items decides what happens to those items' stamp. | (a) **no** — set at creation only; to change it, create a new bin and move the items (subject to P6); (b) yes, and existing items in it are re-stamped | (a) — it is what "at the creation of bin" says, and it keeps the stamp trustworthy | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P6b** | Can an **assemblable** item be moved **into** a non-assemblable bin? | Doing so would make a cycle that needs building drop off the build line. | (a) **no** — non-assemblable bins take only non-assemblable items (inbound via rules, P4) and items already stamped; (b) yes — moving it in stamps it non-assemblable | (b) — the rule-based inward (P4) needs it for the first put-away, and a wrongly placed spare can still be put where it belongs | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P7** | **Non-assemblable units elsewhere.** On the assembled vs unassembled page (R11), in the outward ★ picking (R16) and in the dashboard's condition row. | Otherwise non-assemblable stock is counted as "unassembled" everywhere except the build line. | (a) a third column **"No assembly"** on the condition page and dashboard; ★ picks them like assembled units (they need only the transfer); (b) hide them from those screens | (a) | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P8** | **Generate unit codes for existing binned items (R41): how many, and in what condition?** Existing stock is a **quantity**: `BinStock` per bin (only where put-away/bins set it), `Product.binId` (a single home bin), and `StockLevel` per warehouse. Nothing records per-bin quantity for older stock. | Decides the source of the count and whether the build line floods: most **floor** stock is already built, so marking it all unassembled would put every floor cycle on Awaiting. | Count: (a) per warehouse, `StockLevel` − live units, placed in the product's bin from `BinStock` (then `Product.binId`); (b) `BinStock` rows only. Condition: (i) the person chooses per run; (ii) **FLOOR → assembled, GODOWN → unassembled**, non-assemblable bin → no assembly; (iii) all unassembled | (a) + (ii) — every counted item gets a code, and the default matches how stores hold stock; the person can still pick (i) before running | **count (a); condition = as inward** 17 Sep — see 1.1 |
| **P9** | **Does R41 replace the reset + unit-level audit (Q13, Q43)?** Generating codes gives existing stock units without a reset. | Two ways to create units for old stock; the reset clears counts and units. | (a) keep **both**: generate codes first (fast, no stock change), then a unit-level audit per warehouse corrects counts and condition, with reset only when a warehouse's numbers are unusable; (b) generate replaces reset + audit; (c) reset + audit only, no generate | (a) | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P10** | **"Apply rule to existing stock" (R40): what moves?** | Existing items may be in **no** bin or in **another** bin already. | (a) matching items with **no bin** move to the rule's bin; items already in another bin are listed and moved only if the person ticks "also move these N"; (b) move everything that matches; (c) only set `Product.binId` (the home bin) without moving any unit | (a) — nothing that was deliberately placed moves silently; every move writes a `BinMovementLog` | **(b)** 17 Sep |
| **P11** | **Bin-level stock source of truth (R38).** Today `BinStock` and unit `binId` are updated separately and already disagree (unit moves and transfers change `binId` only). | The outward must reduce "the bin" — by which record? | (a) **units are the truth**: once an item has units, `BinStock` is recomputed from the count of live units per bin after every unit change (sale, move, transfer, audit); items without units keep today's `BinStock`; (b) keep both and decrement `BinStock` alongside | (a) — one record cannot disagree with itself | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P12** | **Category parent from Zoho (R43).** The Zoho import is **deliberately flat** today — an earlier owner decision (D4) — and nothing pushes categories to Zoho. | Reverses D4; decides whether local edits go to Zoho. | (a) the import **sets `parentId` from Zoho's `parent_category_id`** (re-run fills existing rows); `/categories` gets a parent picker for local categories; **no push to Zoho**; (b) also push local changes to Zoho | (a) — Zoho stays the source; pushing is a separate integration | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P12a** | **How are categories "cleared" before the re-import (R47)?** Categories are never deleted today (plan 0809), and three tables point at them: `Product.categoryId`, `HomeBinRule.categoryId` (cascade) and `InboundShipment.categoryId` (**Restrict** — blocks the delete). | A wipe must detach or remove those links first; an in-place re-import needs no wipe. | (a) **no wipe**: the import updates existing rows by `zohoCategoryId`, sets every parent, re-links **every product** to its Zoho category (by `Product.zohoItemId` → Zoho item `category_id`), and marks categories **not in Zoho** inactive; (b) a script `db:wipe:categories` that detaches products, deletes category-based home-bin rules, nulls inbound shipment categories, deletes all categories — then import | (a) — same end result, no broken rules or shipments, and it can be re-run any time | **(b) database-level clearing** 17 Sep |
| **P13** | **Subcategory in rules and filters (R39, R43).** | A rule on a **parent** could match its children's products or only products filed directly under the parent. | (a) a rule on a parent **matches the whole subtree** unless a more specific subcategory rule exists; precedence product > brand+subcategory > brand+category > subcategory > category > brand; the `/stock` filter on a parent includes its children | (a) | **Owner's rule** 17 Sep — see 1.1 |
| **P14** | **Saving the contact to the phone (R44).** The app is a web app (PWA). A browser **cannot write to the phone's contacts silently** — no web API allows it. | Decides what "save to phone" can mean. | (a) **Save contact** also downloads a **vCard** (`.vcf`); the phone opens "Add contact" pre-filled and the user taps Save once — works on Android and iPhone, reuses `api/vcard`; (b) **Google Contacts sync**: the app writes the contact into one shared business Google account (People API); every phone signed into that account gets it with no tap — needs a Google Cloud project, OAuth consent and a stored token; (c) a **native Android app** wrapper with contacts permission — silent save, a new app to build and ship | (a) now; (b) as a separate piece of work if one tap is too many | **(b) Google Contacts sync** 17 Sep |
| **P14a** | **Which Google account, and who connects it?** | The People API writes into exactly one signed-in account; phones see the contacts only if they are signed into it. | (a) **one shop Google account** (e.g. the inventory Gmail), connected once by an admin from **Settings › Integrations › Google Contacts** (`settings.edit`) with a "Connect Google" button; the credentials are stored like Zoho's (`IntegrationConfig` row `provider = "google_contacts"`, S:1386 — no migration); every staff phone that should see customers signs into that account's contacts; (b) each user connects **their own** Google account and gets only the contacts they saved | (a) | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P14b** | **What is saved, and what happens when the phone number already exists in Google?** | Duplicates pile up on every repeat customer. | (a) search Google by phone first; **if found, leave it** (the app never overwrites a customer either); if not, create **name** = customer name, **phones** = `+91-` phone and alternate phone, **note** = "BCH · invoice INV-… · <date>", in a contact group **"BCH Customers"**; (b) always create; (c) found → update name and note | (a) | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P14c** | **Failure and existing customers.** Google can be disconnected, rate-limited or offline. | Decides whether Save Customer can fail because of Google, and whether older customers are synced. | (a) Save Customer **always saves in the app first**; the Google write happens after, and a failure shows "Saved — not synced to Google" with a **Retry** button (logged, never blocks the outward); plus a one-time **"Sync all customers"** button in the Google Contacts settings for customers saved before; (b) Save Customer fails if Google fails; no backfill | (a) | **Owner's flow** 17 Sep — see 1.1 |
| **P14d** | Besides the Customers list, should **Save Customer** on the outward **also** try to sync that one customer to Google in the background? | Without it every new customer waits until someone ticks it on the Customers list. | (a) **no** — sync only from the Customers list, exactly as described; (b) yes — try in the background after saving; a failure only leaves the customer "not synced" on the list | (a) — it is the flow the owner described; (b) can be switched on later without redesign | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P15** | **Where does Find stock search (R45)?** Q7 said "the warehouse" = the **same store's godown**. R45 says "all over the warehouse like floor and godown". | Another store's floor or godown is a **store-to-store** transfer: a GST **tax invoice**, not a delivery challan (`src/lib/transfers/mode.ts:21-23`). | (a) **every store's** floors and godowns, same store listed first; a source in another store creates a `STORE_TO_STORE` request; (b) same store's godowns only (as Q7) | (a) — it is what "all over" says, and nearest-first keeps the usual case one tap | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P16** | **What is the "transfer request" that Find stock creates?** A transfer order today **requires its document at create** (`api/transfer-orders/route.ts:60-63, 310-325`), and the outward person does not have the challan or invoice. | Decides whether a new record type exists. | (a) a **transfer order in `PENDING`** created from the outward, linked to it, with the **document optional until dispatch** (required before `IN_TRANSIT`); (b) a new "transfer request" record that the transfer person later turns into an order | (a) — one flow and one approval screen; no second record to keep in step | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P17** | **Where approvers see requests — "dashboard or a notification section".** There is **no in-app notification inbox** today: `NotificationOutbox` (S:1659) is a log of push/email sends, not a user-facing list with read state. | A real inbox is a new table plus read/unread handling. | (a) a **Requests** section (`/approvals`) built **from the records themselves** — every inbound, outbound, transfer and audit waiting for an approval the viewer's role can give — with a count badge in the header and the dashboard's "Approvals waiting" card linking to it; push as planned; (b) a new notification inbox table with read/unread for every push | (a) — it can never disagree with the records, needs no read state, and covers R24 too | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P18** | **When does stock move for these transfers ("after complete the reduction must happen")?** Today stock **leaves the source at dispatch** and **arrives at receive** (`dispatch/route.ts:148`, `receive/route.ts:155`). | Moving everything only at completion would leave the source showing stock that is already on a truck. | (a) keep today: **out of the source at dispatch, into the destination at receive**, both at warehouse, bin and unit level (Part B); "completed" = received; (b) both sides only at receive | (a) | **(a)** 17 Sep |
| **P19** | **After the transfer arrives, is the stock held for the outward automatically?** Today a received transfer holds nothing; staff press "Reserve stock now". | The customer's cycle could be sold to a walk-in between receive and reserve. | (a) receiving a transfer **linked to an outward** holds that outward's stock at once, and the units reserved for it move with the transfer; (b) staff reserve by hand, as today | (a) | **(a)** 17 Sep |

### 1.1 Decisions on record

| # | Decision | Date |
|---|---|---|
| — | Build on `feat/1709-priority-build-stock-flow`; requirements committed as `dcdb594`. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| — | Plan first, then **pause for approval**; the build then runs with parallel agents, one commit per wave. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P1 | (a) — bin-mode inbound receive also writes `StockLevel` into the bin's warehouse. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P2 | (a) — deleting an inbound shipment retires its unsold units (`LOST`). Owner: *"a go with the recomendation"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P3 | (a) — a reset marks units `RESET` (history kept) and cancels their open assembly tasks. Owner: *"go with t tion A"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P4 | **Owner's own answer, not one of the options as written:** *"see when the inword happens it stays as the unassembled here asembled and unassembled worksrespected to the bin where if the bin is set to no assemblable then those respected bin resped ruls has some category and brand where if the inword matched that it stayas ad non assembelayble and if i make clean up it must clean up it must clen up the respect scope data"*. Read as: (1) **every inward** — inbound receive **and** `inventory/inwards/verify` — creates **unassembled** units; (2) if a **home-bin rule** (brand · category · subcategory) matches the item in the receiving warehouse, the units go **into that rule's bin**, so an item whose rule bin is non-assemblable is **non-assemblable from the moment it arrives**; a bin picked by hand on receive still wins; (3) **cleanup** (`api/inventory/cleanup`, the Zoho-import cleanup in Settings › Integrations) must clean up **everything in its scope** — the Zoho-verified stock it reverses **and** the units and bin stock those inwards created — inside transactions. *Point (2) is Claude's reading of "if the inward matched that it stays as non-assemblable"; the owner may correct it.* | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P5 | (a) — `Module.dividerBefore`, set on `inbound`. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P6 | **Owner's own answer:** *"make it a non assembleable bin items cant be moved to assembleable bin a bin can be markeds non assembleable with booolen colum at the creaon of bin"*. (1) `Bin.nonAssemblable Boolean`, set **when the bin is created** (bin create form). (2) **Items in a non-assemblable bin cannot be moved into an assemblable bin** — `bins/move`, put-away, apply-rule and transfer put-away refuse it with a clear message. (3) So that the rule survives a **transfer** (units have no bin while in transit and on arrival), each unit also carries `InventoryUnit.nonAssemblable`, stamped when it enters a non-assemblable bin; it is what the Awaiting filter reads and what the move check enforces. *Point (3) is how Claude keeps rule (2) true across transfers; it adds no choice for the owner.* Open follow-ups: **P6a** can the flag be changed after the bin is created; **P6b** can an assemblable item be moved **into** a non-assemblable bin. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P6a | (a) — the non-assemblable flag is set **only at bin creation**; read-only on edit (`api/bins/[id]` rejects a change). Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P6b | (a) — moving an assemblable item **into** a non-assemblable bin is allowed and stamps it non-assemblable (it then cannot move back to a normal bin). Owner: *"a"*. *Claude's addition for a wrong placement, which the owner may drop:* a user holding `bins.edit` can **Mark as assemblable** on a single unit (reason required, `logActivity`), which clears the stamp so it can be moved to a normal bin. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P7 | (a) — non-assemblable stock shows as a third group **"No assembly"** on the condition page and the dashboard's condition row, and ★ picking may reserve it (it needs only the transfer). Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P8 (count) | **(a) implied by R46** — **each physical item gets its own, different code** (`U-000087`, `U-000088`, `U-000089`, … — `U-000086` was only the owner's example of the format); the number of new codes = warehouse stock minus existing live units, so 10 boxed cycles get 10 separate codes; same `nextUnitCode` sequence (`src/lib/sequence.ts:129-133`, row-locked counter, so codes never repeat). Owner: *"the code that we see in /assembly awaiting assignment sceen U-000086 this kind of code must be generated where those must be unique where i will use this code in the lable and i will the print and paste it on the products"* and, correcting Claude's wording, *"every item get saparate unique code of it respected to units"*. Condition: see P8 (condition). | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P8 (condition) | **Owner's answer:** *"ven its assemble or non assemble it must genrate code thats it"* — generating codes is **only** code creation: **every item in scope gets a code whatever its condition**, with no condition prompt. Units are created the same way an inward creates them (P4): **unassembled**, or **no assembly** when the bin is non-assemblable. Built cycles that get an unassembled code are corrected by the **unit-level stock audit** (Q42: assembled qty + unassembled qty), not by the generate button. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P9 | (a) — keep both: **Generate unit codes** gives old stock codes without changing counts; the **unit-level audit** (assembled + unassembled qty) sets condition and fixes counts; **reset** stays for a warehouse whose numbers are unusable. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P10 | (b) — **Apply to existing stock moves every matching item** in that warehouse into the rule's bin, including items already in another bin; the dry run still lists what will move and waits for Confirm; every move is logged. P6 still holds: a non-assemblable item is never moved into an assemblable bin (those are listed as skipped). Owner: *"option b"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P11 | (a) — **units are the truth for bin quantity**: after any unit change, `BinStock` is recounted from the live units in each bin touched; products with no units keep today's `BinStock` until codes are generated. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P12 | (a) — Zoho is the source; the import saves parent/child from Zoho; nothing is sent to Zoho. Owner also asked (R47) that **products carry their Zoho category** and that he will clear and re-import. *How to clear* is **P12a**. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P12a | (b) — **database-level clearing**: a script `npm run db:wipe:categories`, then the Zoho import. Owner: *"database level clearing"*. Home-bin rules that use a category are deleted by it and must be re-created after the import. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P13 | **Owner's own answer:** *"yes it must also have explicitly children an must select the subcategry if the parent has a subcategory if the categrory donyt has one no need t selct the subcategory"*. (1) **Home-bin rules are explicit**: when the chosen category **has subcategories, choosing a subcategory is required**; when it has none, the category alone is enough. A rule therefore always names a category with no children, and a parent never covers its children in rules. Precedence: product → brand + category → category → brand. (2) **`/stock` filter**: choosing a parent **includes its children's products** ("yes"); choosing a child shows only its own. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P14 | (b) — **Google Contacts sync**: Save Customer on an outward also writes the contact into the shop's Google account through the People API, so it appears on every phone signed into that account. Owner: *"google contact sync we can make it"*. Follow-ups **P14a–P14c**. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P14a | (a) — **one shop Google account**, connected once by an admin in Settings › Integrations › Google Contacts; client ID/secret entered on that card and stored in `IntegrationConfig` (`provider = "google_contacts"`); setup steps in §3.13. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P14b | (a) — search Google by phone first; found → leave it untouched; not found → create name, `+91-` phone + alternate, note "BCH · <invoice> · <date>", group "BCH Customers". Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P14c | **Owner's own answer:** *"what we can make is save in the aplication level first and after that in the customer listing screen can we able to add or check from there to add the contact to google sync"*. (1) **Save Customer saves in the app only** — Google is never contacted from the outward, so Google can never block an outward. (2) The **Customers list** (`/customers`) shows a **Google** column (synced / not synced) and lets a user **tick customers** (or "select all not synced") and tap **Sync to Google**; results per customer (synced, already in Google, failed + reason). This also covers older customers, so no separate backfill button. *Open: **P14d** — whether Save Customer should additionally try to sync on its own.* | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P14d | (a) — **no automatic sync**; Google sync happens only from the Customers list. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P15 | (a) — Find stock searches **every store's floors and godowns**, same store first; another store as source creates a `STORE_TO_STORE` transfer (tax invoice). The ★ auto-pick (Q35) still uses the same store's godown only. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P16 (partial) | **Owner's answer:** *"we can have a find stock liek first let them selct the store for selcted store and it must check in ther ewarehouse of floore and godown and only the transfer need the document not finding it we can g with option or else we can must make it manditoy by uploding the invoice"*. (1) **Find stock asks for the store first**, then shows that store's **floor and godown** warehouses holding the product (refines P15: every store is selectable; the outward's own store is preselected). (2) **Finding needs no document; only the transfer does.** *Open:* the document is either attached **before dispatch** (option a) or **uploaded when the transfer request is created** — see P16 below. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P16 | (a) — the Find-stock transfer request is a normal transfer order created `PENDING` **without** a document; the document is **required before dispatch**. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P17 | (a) — a **Requests** page (`/approvals`) built from the records waiting for an approval the viewer's role can give, a count badge in the header, linked from the dashboard's Approvals waiting card; push as planned; no inbox table. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P18 | (a) — stock leaves the source at **dispatch** and arrives at **receive**, each at warehouse, bin and unit level; "completed" = received. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |
| P19 | (a) — receiving a transfer linked to an outward **holds that outward's stock at once**; the units reserved for it arrive with it. Owner: *"a"*. | 17 Sep 2026 |

## 2. How it works today — verified against the code

The full current-state record is the requirements doc **§5** (re-verified 17 Sep at `861a237`).
What follows is only what decides *this* build's design, including what the planning agents found
beyond §5.

### 2.1 Every place stock quantity changes (the R7 surface)

Shared helpers `src/lib/stock-location.ts`: `adjustWarehouseQty` :51 (clamps at 0),
`deductFromStore` :106 (floor then godown), `deductAnywhere` :178, `addAnywhere` :212,
`setWarehouseQty` :306. `src/lib/transfers/stock.ts`: `moveOutOfWarehouse` :38,
`moveIntoWarehouse` :79. **None touch `InventoryUnit`.** Unit codes: `nextUnitCode(db)`
`src/lib/sequence.ts:129-133` (row-locked `counter` upsert).

| Path | Quantity change | Units today |
|---|---|---|
| `inbound/[id]/route.ts` receive | bin mode: `currentStock` + `BinStock` only (:265-284, **P1**); no-bin: `adjustWarehouseQty` (:286-301) | created (:312-324) |
| `inbound/[id]/route.ts` DELETE | `deductAnywhere` (:525) | **untouched (P2)** |
| `inventory/inwards/verify` | `adjustWarehouseQty` / `addAnywhere` (:50-52) | none (**P4**) |
| `inventory/cleanup` DELETE | reversals, **no transaction** (:37-39) | none (**P4**) |
| `inventory/outwards` POST | `deductFromStore` (:98) | none |
| `transfer-orders/[id]/dispatch` | `moveOutOfWarehouse` (:148) | only if `unitIds` sent (:177-196) — **the UI never sends them** (`transfers/[id]/_components/dispatch-sheet.tsx:103-112`) |
| `transfer-orders/[id]/receive` | `moveIntoWarehouse` (:155); shortfall ADJUSTMENT row (:179) | moves every dispatched unit, sets `PUT_AWAY`, **ignores `receivedQty`** (:195-212) |
| `deliveries/[id]/route.ts` DELIVERED / WALK_OUT | `deductDeliveryFromFloor` (:351) | none |
| `deliveries/batch` DELIVERED | `deductDeliveryFromFloor` (:111) | none |
| `stock-counts/[id]` approve + apply | per line `delta = counted − live` (:423); `setWarehouseQty` (:430), surplus `adjustWarehouseQty` (:433), shortage `deductFromStore` (:439), bin (:444) | none |
| `stock-counts/[id]` DELETE completed | sets `currentStock` directly, no `StockLevel` (:605-612) | none — out of scope (§5) |
| `stock-reset` | `location` bin-prefix only; zeroes all `StockLevel` rows of matched products (:24-61); **no UI calls it** | none |
| `bins/move`, `bins/assign`, `inbound/[id]/putaway` | `BinStock` only | bin / status only |

Delivery lines are JSON, not rows: `Delivery.lineItems {name, sku, quantity}`; `stockLines()`
`src/lib/deliveries/floor-stock.ts:41` keeps SKU lines only; `deductDeliveryFromFloor` :165 checks
then writes `stockLevel.update` directly (:201). Pre-booked deliveries carry no SKU.

### 2.2 Approvals, notifications, settings

- **Inbound approve** `api/inbound/[id]/approve/route.ts`: no body, `inbound.approve` :18, 400 if
  already approved :27, stamps `approvedAt/ById` + `logActivity` :32-54. UI
  `inbound/[id]/page.tsx:580-596`; receive controls need `isApproved` (:598…). No reject, no
  request step.
- **Transfer approve** `transfer-orders/[id]/approve/route.ts` body `{action, rejectionNote?}`
  :16-19; reject claims `PENDING` with `updateMany` :84-115; approve re-checks source stock
  :131-140. Detail UI `transfers/[id]/page.tsx` posts `{action}` only, **no note** (:145-156);
  buttons from `computeActions` `src/lib/transfers/actions.ts:64-70`. List page approves too
  (`transfers/page.tsx:126-130`). **No edit route** for an order after create. Auto-approve on
  create `transfer-orders/route.ts:370-373`.
- **Stock count** PUT `stock-counts/[id]/route.ts:127`; self-block **:172-175**; UI hides approve
  for the assignee `stock-audit/[id]/page.tsx:450`; approval screen `stock-audit/[id]/review/page.tsx:222-234`.
- **Deliveries** `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`: `dispatch-form.tsx:35` via `detail-actions.tsx:127-139`, and
  batch `deliveries/dispatch/page.tsx:219` → `api/deliveries/batch` (≤ 50 ids, `deliveries.edit`).
  `SHIPPED`: `detail-actions.tsx:205-222`.
- **Notify** `notify(eventKey, {recipients, title, body, refId?, link?, data?})`
  `src/lib/notify/index.ts:55`, called **after commit** (`types.ts:46-51`); events registry
  `src/lib/notify/events.ts:27-53` `{label, description, defaults}`; recipients from
  `usersWithPermission(module, action)` `src/lib/rbac.ts:271`. FCM message
  `src/lib/notify/push.ts:370-393` (notification + data, **no actions**); `public/sw.js` push
  :49-85, click :87-115 (no `event.action`). Master switch ships off. **No native app** in the
  repo — Android devices are web push in Chrome, which supports actions.
- **Settings** `AppSetting {key, value, updatedAt}` (S:2514). Pattern to copy:
  `src/lib/settings/bin-tracking.ts` (cached reader :16-42, upsert :47-75) + its route.
- **Activity log** `logActivity(db, entry)` `src/lib/activity-log.ts:76`.
- **Vendor issue** `VendorIssue` (S:1777), POST `api/vendor-issues` (`vendor_issues.create`),
  required `issueType` + `description` (+ `vendorId` for VENDOR). **No product or unit column.**
  `InventoryUnit.inboundShipmentId` → `InboundShipment.brandId` / `vendorBillId` (S:2238, :2272).

### 2.3 Screens

- `/assembly` `page.tsx` is **1278 lines, all inline**: tabs :505-507, Awaiting :573-683, Tasks
  :684-805, My Build Queue :806-998, hold modal :1000-1064, assign modal :1164-end. GET
  `api/assembly/tasks` params :35-41, 50-row pending page, `unitCode asc`, response :137-146.
- `/scanner` `scanner/page.tsx` (290 lines, inline, "Search & Scanner").
- Sidebar `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`: tree :94-140, child sort :159, parent row :299-341,
  children :345-365, **no divider**. Other renderers: `components/desktop/sidebar.tsx`,
  `components/header-menu.tsx`, `(dashboard)/more/page.tsx`, hub `stock-management/page.tsx`.
- Catalog today (`prisma/rbac-catalog.ts`): see requirements doc §5.7 and the table in the
  planning notes — `stock_management` 100 (route, `view`); children stock 101, categories 103,
  stock_audit 104, inbound 105, deliveries 106, transfers 107, bins 108, brands 108;
  roots second_hand 150, barcode 160, pos 170, assembly 180, complaints 185; customers 320
  (Accounts); settings 520 with route-less children 521-525; store_management 540 (no route) →
  stores 541, warehouses 542 (no route).
- `/stores` 499 lines, no tabs; `/bins` 2230 lines, tabs directory | unmatched; no `/warehouses`.
- `/stock` 1145 lines; quick chips :68 rendered :521-532; filters are state → `/api/products`
  (:287-310).
- Dashboard `(dashboard)/page.tsx`: six variants, `pickDashboard` :956; endpoints per variant
  :245-251, :495-499, :637-638, :752, :867-869, :910-912.

### 2.4 Database target — read before any schema command

`.env` **line 9 is active and points at the Supabase pooler** (the cloud test database); localhost
`bch_local` is commented at line 13. Migrations rule 2 and 5 (CLAUDE.md) and the owner's 9 Sep rule
apply: `migrate` runs **only** against localhost. Export `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` to
`bch_local` in the shell for the migration step; never edit `.env`; never `db push`.

### 2.5 Bins, categories and contacts (for R38–R44)

- **Category tree already exists in the schema**: `Category.parentId` + `children` (S:492-494),
  `zohoCategoryId @unique` (S:500). API `api/categories` GET returns `parent` and `children`
  (:26-34); POST/PATCH accept `parentId` (`validations.ts:123, 131-137`); PATCH rejects cycles
  (:58-73) and deactivation cascades to the subtree (:109-164).
- **Zoho import is deliberately flat**: `api/categories/zoho-import/route.ts:25-27` ignores
  `parent_category_id` (earlier decision D4); rows created `{name, zohoCategoryId}` (:153-154).
  The Zoho client already types `parent_category_id` (`src/lib/integrations/inventory.ts:27`,
  list :121-141). Only the offline `scripts/gen-catalog-sql.js:214-215` sets parents. **No push
  to Zoho exists.**
- **`/categories` UI is flat**: list filtered by status (`categories/page.tsx:282-285`), "N sub"
  badge (:405-409), "in {parent}" (:411-413); create sends `{name}` (:154), edit `{name}` (:134-135);
  **no parent picker**.
- **`/stock` category filter is flat** (`stock/page.tsx:547-561`); `api/products/route.ts:100`
  filters `categoryId` exactly — a parent does **not** include its children.
- **Home-bin rules** `api/bins/home-rules/route.ts`: GET `bins.view`, POST `bins.edit`
  `{warehouseId, brandId?, categoryId?, productId?, binId}` upsert by criteria (:40-109), DELETE
  (:111-125). Applied **only** as the put-away suggestion (`api/inbound/[id]/putaway/route.ts:49-113`,
  precedence product → brand+category → category → brand → `Product.binId`), exact category match.
  UI: modal in `bins/page.tsx:2070-2225` (brand, flat category, bin; no product). **No "apply to
  existing stock" anywhere.**
- **Where "in a bin" is recorded**: `BinStock` (written by receive-with-bin, put-away, `bins/assign`,
  `bins/move`, bin-scoped audit — never seeded for older stock); `Product.binId` (receive,
  `products/bulk` :116-129); unit `binId`. **They are not kept equal**: `bins/move` changes unit
  `binId` only (:65-71); transfer dispatch/receive null unit `binId` without `BinStock`.
- **Bin flags**: only `isAssemblyArea` (S:708) and `isActive`; no "non-assemblable".
- **Outward never touches bins**: `deductDeliveryFromFloor` updates `StockLevel` only
  (`floor-stock.ts:165-219`); `inventory/outwards` puts `binId` into notes text only (:102-103).
- **Save contact** `api/deliveries/[id]/customer/route.ts:42-120` writes the database only
  (`customer-info-card.tsx:6` says so). A vCard route exists with **no callers**
  (`api/vcard/route.ts:3-26`), and the service counter already downloads a vCard in the browser
  (`services/counter/page.tsx:51-80`). The app is a PWA (`public/manifest.json`); no Google user
  OAuth, no Contact Picker, no native wrapper.

---

## 3. Implementation plan

### 3.0 Shape of the build

Eight parts, built in **four waves**. A wave's agents run in parallel on **disjoint files**; each
wave is checked (`npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx eslint` on touched files) and committed before the next
starts.

```
Wave 0  S  schema + migration + catalog + shared libs (one agent, serial)
        └─ schema-reviewer agent reads the migration before Wave 1
Wave 1  B  unit lifecycle      E  assembly screen      F  sidebar, stock, stores      I  category tree
Wave 2  C  outward guard, ★, outbound approval, vCard      D  approvals      H  bins: rules, codes, non-assemblable
Wave 3  G  dashboard      Q  notification action buttons + quick approve
```

Why this order: B's unit helpers are needed by C (★ reservation), D (short receive, reversal) and
H (generate codes, apply rules, bin-level stock); I's subtree helper is used by H's rule matching;
C and D both need S's `ApprovalEvent` writer and notify events; G reads what B–D and H write.
**Parts H and I, and the R42 parts of B, E, F, assume the recommended defaults of P6–P14.**

### 3.1 Wave 0 — Part S: schema, migration, catalog, shared libs

**One migration** `prisma/migrations/<ts>_priority_build_stock_flow/`, all additive (rule 7):

| Model | Change | For |
|---|---|---|
| `enum HoldIssue` | new: `CYCLE`, `WORKFLOOR` | R3, R6 |
| `AssemblyTask` | `holdIssue HoldIssue?`, `holdNote String?`. `holdReason` stays (no longer written) | R6, Q3 |
| `enum UnitStatus` | add `RESET` | P3 |
| `InventoryUnit` | `reservedForDeliveryId String?` → `Delivery` `onDelete: SetNull`, `@@index`; `reservedAt DateTime?` (`soldAt`, `saleInvoiceNo` already exist, S:786-787) | R16, R21 |
| `Delivery` | `priorityAt DateTime?`, `priorityById String?` (→ User, SetNull); `approvalRequestedAt`, `approvalRequestedById`, `approvedAt`, `approvedById`, `approvalReturnedAt DateTime?`, `approvalNote String?` | R19–R21, R26a |
| `enum TransferOrderStatus` | add `RETURNED` (`REJECTED` stays for old rows) | R25 |
| `TransferOrder` | `resubmittedAt DateTime?` | R25 |
| `InboundShipment` | `rejectedAt`, `rejectedById` (→ User), `rejectionNote String?`, `resubmittedAt DateTime?` | R25, Q17 |
| `StockCountItem` | `assembledQty Int?`, `unassembledQty Int?` | Q42 |
| `enum ApprovalActivity` | new: `INBOUND`, `OUTBOUND`, `TRANSFER`, `STOCK_AUDIT` | R26 |
| `enum ApprovalEventType` | new: `REQUESTED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `RESUBMITTED`, `REVERSED`, `CORRECTED`, `SHORT_RECEIVED`, `FLAGGED` | R26 |
| `ApprovalEvent` (new) | `id`, `activity`, `event`, `recordId`, `recordRef?`, `actorId` (→ User), `approverId?` (the approval this outcome judges), `productId?`, `warehouseId?`, `quantity Int?`, `note?`, `createdAt`; indexes `(activity, recordId)`, `(approverId, event, createdAt)`, `(productId, warehouseId, createdAt)` | R26 |
| `Module` | `dividerBefore Boolean @default(false)` | P5 |
| `Bin` | `nonAssemblable Boolean @default(false)` — set on the create form (P6) | R42, P6 |
| `InventoryUnit` | `nonAssemblable Boolean @default(false)` — stamped when the unit enters a non-assemblable bin; kept through transfers (P6) | R42, P6 |
| `TransferOrder` | `deliveryId String?` → `Delivery` `onDelete: SetNull`, `@@index` — the outward a Find-stock request was raised for (`docUrl` is already nullable, S:2158) | R45, P16, P19 |
| `InventoryUnit` | `sourceTransactionId String?` → `InventoryTransaction` `onDelete: SetNull`, `@@index` — the inward ledger row that created the unit, so a cleanup can find exactly its units (P4) | P4 |
| `Customer` | `googleContactId String?`, `googleSyncedAt DateTime?`, `googleSyncError String?` — sync status shown on the Customers list (P14c) | P14c |

Enum `ADD VALUE` statements go in the migration without using the new value in the same
migration. Generated with `migrate diff --script` into a hand-made folder (non-interactive here,
memory), applied to **`bch_local` only** (§2.4), SQL read before commit (rule 3).

**Catalog** `prisma/rbac-catalog.ts` (data; `npm run db:seed:rbac` locally, owner re-seeds elsewhere):

| Key | Change |
|---|---|
| `delivery_priority` | **new**: label "Delivery Priority (★)", `route: null`, group Operations, `actions: ["edit"]` (R19) |
| `assembly` | sortOrder **90** (above Stock management, R27) |
| `stock_management` | `route: null` (expand only, R28) |
| `stock` | label "Stock & inventory", sortOrder 101 |
| `inbound` / `deliveries` / `transfers` / `stock_audit` | labels "1 Inbound", "2 Outbound (delivery & dispatch)", "3 Stock transfer", "4 Stock audit"; sortOrder 110/111/112/113; `inbound.dividerBefore = true` |
| `categories`, `brands` | `route: null` (leave menu, R33) — keys and grants kept |
| `bins` | parent removed → root, `route: null`, group Admin (grant-only, R32) |
| `barcode` | `route: null` (tab, R29) |
| `pos` | group **Accounts**, sortOrder 315 (R30) |
| `customers`, `complaints`, `second_hand` | group **Sales**, sortOrder 250 / 255 / 260 (R31) |
| `store_management` | parentKey **`settings`**, route **`/stores`**, sortOrder 526 (R32) |
| `stores`, `warehouses` | parent removed → roots, `route: null`, group Admin (grant-only) |

No key is renamed or removed — a renamed key deletes its grants (requirements doc §5.7).

**Shared libs** (created here so the waves never edit the same file):

- `src/lib/notify/events.ts` — register `stock.transfer_needed`, `approval.requested`,
  `approval.returned`.
- `src/lib/approvals/events.ts` — `recordApprovalEvent(tx, {...})`, typed on the enums above.
- `src/lib/settings/approval-rules.ts` — reader/writer for AppSetting `approver_error_rule`
  `{countCorrection:true, countShortReceive:true, countReversal:true, countFlag:false, windowDays:7}`.
- `src/lib/settings/stuck-hours.ts` — AppSetting `dashboard_stuck_hours`
  `{approvals:24, inbound:72, holds:24}`.
  Both copy `src/lib/settings/bin-tracking.ts`.

### 3.2 Wave 1 — Part B: unit lifecycle (R7, R11, P1–P4)

**New** `src/lib/units/` — every function takes `tx`, logs with `createLogger("units:*")`:

- `pickUnits(tx, {productId, warehouseId, qty, reservedForDeliveryId?})` — available statuses
  `RECEIVED`, `PUT_AWAY`, `ASSEMBLED`; order: reserved for this delivery first → `assembledAt`
  not null first → `createdAt` asc; excludes units reserved for **another** delivery and units in
  an open task (`ASSIGNED`/`IN_ASSEMBLY`) unless nothing else is left. Throws if fewer than `qty`.
- `moveUnits(tx, unitIds, destWarehouseId)` — sets `warehouseId`, `binId: null`, status
  `ASSEMBLED` if `assembledAt` else `RECEIVED` (fixes defect 6).
- `sellUnits(tx, unitIds, {invoiceNo})` — `SOLD`, `soldAt`, `saleInvoiceNo`, clears reservation.
- `retireUnits(tx, unitIds, status: "LOST" | "RESET")` — clears bin + reservation; `RESET` also
  sets open assembly tasks to `CANCELLED`.
- `createUnits(tx, {productId, warehouseId, qty, assembled, inboundShipmentId?})` — `nextUnitCode`.
- `syncWarehouseUnits(tx, {productId, warehouseId, assembled, unassembled})` — makes the location
  hold exactly those counts **while keeping existing codes** (their labels are already pasted on the
  items, R46, P9): first **re-mark condition** on existing units (unassembled → assembled sets
  `assembledAt`; assembled → unassembled clears it); only when the **total** differs does it
  `createUnits` (surplus) or retire the newest surplus units as `LOST` (shortage). A shortage
  never retires a unit whose code is on a label without listing it in the audit result.
- `syncBinStock(tx, binIds[])` — **R38, P11**: for each bin, `BinStock.quantity` per product =
  count of live units (not SOLD / LOST / RESET / TRANSFERRED) in that bin. Every function above
  that changes a unit's `binId` or status calls it for the bins it touched, so an outward that sells
  a unit from `FLOOR-R3` lowers `FLOOR-R3`'s bin stock in the same transaction. Products with no
  units keep today's `BinStock` untouched.
- `isAssemblable` rule (R42, P6): a unit is **non-assemblable** when `InventoryUnit.nonAssemblable`
  is true — stamped by every unit move into a non-assemblable bin. `assertBinMoveAllowed(unit, destBin)`
  refuses moving a non-assemblable unit into an assemblable bin (P6). Exported `assemblableUnitWhere`
  so the Awaiting query, the condition page and the dashboard all use the same filter.

**Wiring** (each inside the route's existing transaction):

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `api/inbound/[id]/route.ts` receive | P1: bin mode also `adjustWarehouseQty` into the bin's warehouse |
| `api/inbound/[id]/route.ts` DELETE | P2: `retireUnits(shipment's unsold units, "LOST")` |
| `api/inventory/inwards/verify/route.ts` | **P4**: `createUnits` unassembled for the added qty, `sourceTransactionId` = the INWARD row; placed in the matching home-bin rule's bin when one matches (Part H's `rule-match.ts`; before Wave 2 lands, no bin) |
| `api/inventory/cleanup/route.ts` | **P4**: rewritten to run **inside transactions** (chunks of 100 ledger rows so the 60 s limit holds): for each Zoho-verified INWARD reversed, `retireUnits(units with that sourceTransactionId and not SOLD, "RESET")` + `syncBinStock`; OUTWARD reversals add stock back as today; the GET dry run also reports units and bins affected; `log.info` per chunk |
| `api/inventory/outwards/route.ts` | `sellUnits(pickUnits(...))` per warehouse `deductFromStore` drew from (extend it to return its per-warehouse breakdown) |
| `api/transfer-orders/[id]/dispatch/route.ts` | when `unitIds` absent, `pickUnits` per item from the source; write `TransferOrderUnit` rows as today |
| `api/transfer-orders/[id]/receive/route.ts` | per item move only `receivedQty` units; the rest `retireUnits("LOST")` |
| `api/deliveries/[id]/route.ts` DELIVERED / WALK_OUT, `api/deliveries/batch/route.ts` DELIVERED | after `deductDeliveryFromFloor`, per `DeductedLine` `sellUnits(pickUnits(floor, reservedForDeliveryId: delivery.id))` |
| `api/stock-counts/[id]/route.ts` apply | line with `assembledQty`/`unassembledQty` → `syncWarehouseUnits`; line without the split → delta: surplus `createUnits` unassembled, shortage `retireUnits("LOST")` via `pickUnits` reversed (unassembled first) |
| `api/stock-counts/[id]/items/route.ts` + `stock-audit/[id]/page.tsx` counting inputs | two inputs per line, **Assembled** and **Unassembled**; `countedQty` = their sum (Q42) |
| `api/stock-counts/[id]/zero-uncounted/route.ts` | also sets both split fields to 0 |
| **new** `api/stock-reset/warehouse/route.ts` (`stock_audit.approve`, confirm string) | Q43: one warehouse — zero its `StockLevel` (qty + reserved) and `BinStock`, `retireUnits(all non-SOLD units there, "RESET")`, recompute product totals, one ADJUSTMENT ledger row per product, `logActivity` |
| **new** reset button on `stock-audit` (list page, approvers only) | pick store → warehouse → type the confirm string; then offer "Start unit-level audit for this warehouse" |

The old `api/stock-reset` (bin-prefix, no UI) is left untouched and not linked.

### 3.3 Wave 1 — Part E: assembly screen (R1–R6, R8, R9, R20, R29, Q5, Q6)

Split `src/app/(dashboard)/assembly/page.tsx` into `_components/` first (no behaviour change),
then build on the pieces:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `assembly/page.tsx` | `Suspense` wrapper + `useSearchParams` + `router.replace(?tab=, {scroll:false})`, copied from `purchase-orders/page.tsx:76-105`; tabs `awaiting`/`tasks` (`assembly.approve`), `mine` (`assembly.edit`), `labels` (`barcode.view`); unknown or forbidden tab → today's landing rule (R2) |
| `_components/hold-sheet.tsx` (new) | two large boxes, one tap → POST, sheet closes; no confirm, no text |
| `api/assembly/tasks/[id]/hold/route.ts` | zod body `{action:"HOLD", issue: "CYCLE"\|"WORKFLOOR"}` / `{action:"RESUME"}`; writes `holdIssue`; `logActivity` on hold and resume |
| `api/assembly/tasks/[id]/start`, `complete` | `logActivity` (defect 5) |
| **new** `api/assembly/tasks/[id]/hold-note/route.ts` | PUT `{note}`, `assembly.approve` |
| `_components/my-queue-tab.tsx` | timer shows `(holdStartedAt − startedAt) − totalHoldSeconds` when `ON_HOLD` (defect 1); ★ badge + delivery day; ★ first (Q20 order) |
| `_components/tasks-tab.tsx` | held builds list: unit · product · issue · mechanic · on hold since · note (edit); **Raise vendor issue** on `CYCLE` holds → `/vendor-issues/new?description=…&vendorId=…` (description "U-000481 · Hero Sprint 29 · Issue with the cycle"; vendor from the unit's inbound shipment where resolvable, else blank) |
| vendor issue create page | accept those query params as initial values (no schema change) |
| `api/assembly/tasks/route.ts` GET | filters `productId`, `brandId`, `warehouseId`, `binId`, `q`; sort `delivery`/`received`/`model`; ★ units (`reservedForDeliveryId` set) first by delivery day then `priorityAt`; page size 100 **plus** `pendingIds` mode that returns every matching id (R8) |
| `api/assembly/tasks/route.ts` POST | accept `unitIds[]` (≤ 500) in one transaction, same checks per unit as today |
| `_components/awaiting-tab.tsx` | filter bar, sort select, row checkboxes, "Select all N matching", bulk Assign; ★ rows show delivery day and a **Swap** action (calls Part C's swap route; hidden until Wave 2 lands) |
| **new** `src/components/scanner/scanner-panel.tsx` | body of `scanner/page.tsx` extracted; `/scanner` renders it; `_components/labels-tab.tsx` renders it |
| Awaiting query + **new** `_components/no-assembly-tab.tsx` (`?tab=no-assembly`, `assembly.view`) | R42: Awaiting excludes units in non-assemblable bins (`assemblableUnitWhere`); the new tab lists them (unit · product · warehouse · bin), same filters, no assign action |

### 3.4 Wave 1 — Part F: sidebar, stock & inventory, store management (R10, R11, R27–R33)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/stores/permissions.ts` + module API | carry `dividerBefore` |
| `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` | parent with `route: null` renders as a button that only toggles (R28); `dividerBefore` renders a divider above that child |
| `components/desktop/sidebar.tsx`, `components/header-menu.tsx`, `(dashboard)/more/page.tsx` | same two behaviours so every renderer agrees |
| `(dashboard)/stock/page.tsx` | chips row **Categories · Brands** linking to `/categories`, `/more/brands` (shown by `categories.view` / `brands.view`); **Assembled / Unassembled / No assembly** columns (R10, P7); quick chip **No assembly** (R42); link "Assembled vs unassembled"; category filter uses Part I's tree picker (parent with children indented, R43) |
| `api/products` GET | `categoryId` includes the whole subtree via Part I's `categorySubtreeIds` (R43, P13); `condition=no-assembly` filter |
| `api/products` GET | per product `assembledUnits`, `unassembledUnits` (one grouped query over non-SOLD/LOST/RESET/TRANSFERRED units) |
| **new** `(dashboard)/stock/condition/page.tsx` + `api/stock/condition/route.ts` (`stock.view`) | model · location · assembled · unassembled · **no assembly** (P7) · total; filters store, warehouse, brand; unassembled number links to `/assembly?tab=awaiting&productId=&warehouseId=`, assembled to `/stock?…` (R11) |
| `(dashboard)/stores/page.tsx` | tabs **Stores · Warehouses · Bins** with `?tab=` (Suspense pattern); Stores = today's screen; Warehouses = today's nested warehouse list lifted to its own tab; Bins = today's `/bins` directory extracted into a component; each tab gated by `stores.view` / `warehouses.view` / `bins.view` |
| `(dashboard)/bins/page.tsx` | renders the extracted component (URL kept) |
| `settings/page.tsx` | "Bins & Locations" card → `/stores?tab=bins` |

### 3.5 Wave 2 — Part C: outward guard, ★ priority, outbound approval (R12–R17, R19–R21, R26a, Q11, Q37)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/deliveries/floor-stock.ts` | `stockElsewhere(tx, productId, storeId, floorWarehouseId)` → GODOWN quantities; `ShortLine` gains `elsewhere[]`; the handover refusal names it: "Hero Sprint 29: 0 on BCH Floor · 2 in BCH Godown. A transfer is needed." |
| **new** `src/lib/deliveries/transfer-needed.ts` | `notifyTransferNeeded(delivery, shortLines, actorId?)` → `notify("stock.transfer_needed", usersWithPermission("transfers","create") − actor)`; called **after commit** or after a refused transaction rolled back |
| `api/deliveries/[id]/route.ts` | short hold at SCHEDULED/PACKED → notify; **new check at `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`**: held, or floor usable ≥ lines, else refuse + notify; WALK_OUT/DELIVERED refusal → notify; `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`/`SHIPPED` require `approvedAt` and no later `approvalReturnedAt`; Dummy skipped (R26a) |
| `api/deliveries/batch/route.ts` | same `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` stock check and approval check per id; refusal lists each failing invoice |
| `api/public/delivery/[token]/route.ts` | short hold → notify (no actor) |
| **new** `api/deliveries/[id]/priority/route.ts` | POST `{starred}` — `delivery_priority.edit`; not Dummy; star: per short line `pickUnits` in the store's GODOWN warehouses (`kind = GODOWN`, same `storeId`), set `reservedForDeliveryId`, `reservedAt`; `priorityAt/ById`; unstar: clear both, release units; `logActivity` both ways (R21) |
| **new** `api/deliveries/[id]/priority/swap/route.ts` | POST `{fromUnitId, toUnitId}` — `assembly.approve`; same product, same warehouse, target unreserved and available |
| **new** `src/lib/approvals/actions/delivery.ts` + `api/deliveries/[id]/approval/route.ts` | `request` (`deliveries.edit`), `approve` / `reject {note}` (`deliveries.approve`); writes the fields + `recordApprovalEvent`; notify `approval.requested` / `approval.returned` after commit |
| `api/deliveries/[id]/flag/route.ts` | `recordApprovalEvent(FLAGGED, approverId: delivery.approvedById)` |
| delivery release on DELETE (`[id]/route.ts:456-464`) | also clear units reserved for it |
| `deliveries/[id]/_components/detail-actions.tsx`, `delivery-card.tsx`, `delivery-table.tsx` | ★ toggle (grant-gated); "Request approval" / "Approve" / "Reject" / returned banner; dispatch buttons disabled until approved; short warning shows godown quantities |
| walk-out page `deliveries/[id]/walkout/page.tsx` | shows the new refusal text |
| `deliveries/[id]/_components/customer-info-card.tsx` | **R44, P14c**: unchanged behaviour — Save Customer saves in the app only; a small hint "Sync to Google from Customers" when Google Contacts is connected |
| **new** `src/lib/integrations/google-contacts.ts` | OAuth2 (authorization-code + refresh token) against Google, token refresh like `src/lib/integrations/base.ts`; `findContactByPhone` (People API `people:searchContacts`), `createContact` (`people:createContact`), `ensureContactGroup("BCH Customers")`; every response read with `readJson()`; `log.debug` per request, never the token |
| **new** `api/integrations/google-contacts/{connect,callback,status,disconnect}/route.ts` (`settings.edit`) and `api/customers/google-sync/route.ts` (`customers.edit`) | connect → Google consent (scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts`); callback stores tokens in `IntegrationConfig` `provider = "google_contacts"` with the account email; `google-sync` takes `customerIds[]` (≤ 200 per call), applies P14b per customer, writes `googleContactId` / `googleSyncedAt` / `googleSyncError`, returns per-customer results |
| `(dashboard)/customers/page.tsx` (+ `api/customers` GET) | **P14c**: **Google** column (synced · not synced · failed with reason), row checkboxes, "Select all not synced", **Sync to Google** button (shown when connected and the user holds `customers.edit`), results toast/list |
| `(dashboard)/settings/integrations/page.tsx` | a **Google Contacts** card: client ID + secret, Connect / Disconnect, connected account, last error (P14a) |
| `scripts/db/restore-*` (the `db:restore:local` path) | null the `google_contacts` tokens on restore, as for Zoho (CLAUDE.md migrations rule 10) |
| **new** `api/deliveries/[id]/find-stock/route.ts` | **R45, P15** — `deliveries.edit`, not Dummy. `GET ?storeId=`: for each short line, that store's active **FLOOR and GODOWN** warehouses holding usable stock (`quantity − reservedQuantity`) — the outward's floor excluded; per source: warehouse, kind, qty, assembled/unassembled/no-assembly units (P16 (1)). `POST {sources:[{productId, warehouseId, qty}]}`: creates **one transfer order per source warehouse** to the outward's floor, `PENDING`, `deliveryId` set, no document (P16); mode from the pair (`GODOWN_TO_FLOOR` / `STORE_TO_STORE` / …); reserves the picked units for the outward (`pickUnits` + `reservedForDeliveryId`); `recordApprovalEvent(REQUESTED)`; notify `approval.requested` to `transfers.approve` holders after commit |
| `deliveries/[id]/_components/stock-hold-card.tsx` (+ detail actions) | when the hold is short: **Find stock** → **select store** (outward's store preselected) → that store's floor/godown sources → pick source(s) and qty → **Create transfer request** (document per P16); the card then shows each linked transfer with its status |

### 3.6 Wave 2 — Part D: approvals, returned records, error rule (R22–R26)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/transfers/transitions.ts` | `PENDING → RETURNED`; `RETURNED → PENDING` (resubmit) / `CANCELLED` |
| `api/transfer-orders/[id]/approve/route.ts` | reject writes `RETURNED` (not `REJECTED`) with the note; approve/reject `recordApprovalEvent`; notify `approval.returned` to the creator |
| `api/transfer-orders/route.ts` POST | `recordApprovalEvent(REQUESTED)`; if auto-approved also `APPROVED`; else notify `approval.requested` to `transfers.approve` holders − creator |
| **new** `api/transfer-orders/[id]/route.ts` PATCH | `RETURNED` only, creator or `transfers.create`: replace items (same validation and stock check as create) |
| **new** `api/transfer-orders/[id]/resubmit/route.ts` | `RETURNED → PENDING`, `resubmittedAt`, event + notify |
| `api/transfer-orders/[id]/cancel/route.ts` | cancelling an `APPROVED` order → `REVERSED` event |
| `api/transfer-orders/route.ts` POST validation (`:60-63`, `:310-325`) + `dispatch/route.ts` | **P16**: document optional at create; **required before dispatch** (`IN_TRANSIT`) — dispatch refuses "Attach the delivery challan / tax invoice first"; the existing `[id]/document` route attaches it |
| `api/transfer-orders/[id]/receive/route.ts` (after B) | **P19**: when `deliveryId` is set and the delivery is not Dummy / terminal, call `holdDeliveryStock` for it in the same transaction (units already reserved for it moved with the transfer) |
| **new** `(dashboard)/approvals/page.tsx` + `api/approvals/pending/route.ts` (`requireAuth`; each section `userCan(module, "approve")`) | **P17**: one **Requests** list built from the records — inbound not approved (and not returned), outwards with approval requested, transfers `PENDING`, stock audits `COMPLETED`; each row: what, who asked, when, age, Approve / Reject / Open; header badge with the count (same endpoint, `count` only); catalog: no new module — the page shows only sections the viewer can approve |
| `api/transfer-orders/[id]/receive/route.ts` | received < dispatched → `SHORT_RECEIVED` event (approverId = `reviewedById`) — **edits after Part B's change in the same file** |
| `transfers/[id]/page.tsx`, `transfers/page.tsx`, `src/lib/transfers/actions.ts` | reject opens a note box and sends `rejectionNote`; returned banner; edit items + resubmit for the creator |
| **new** `api/inbound/[id]/reject/route.ts` | `inbound.approve`; not approved, not delivered; `rejectedAt/ById/Note`; event; notify creator |
| **new** `api/inbound/[id]/resubmit/route.ts` | `inbound.edit`; clears `rejectedAt`, sets `resubmittedAt`; event; notify `inbound.approve` holders |
| `api/inbound/[id]/approve/route.ts` | refuse while returned; event `APPROVED` |
| inbound create route | event `REQUESTED` + notify approvers |
| `api/inbound/[id]/route.ts` DELETE of an approved shipment | event `REVERSED` |
| `inbound/[id]/page.tsx` | Reject button + note; returned banner; Resubmit |
| `api/stock-counts/[id]/route.ts` | remove the self-block :172-175 (R23); approve/reject events; apply → one `CORRECTED` event per changed line with `productId`, `warehouseId`, `quantity` = delta |
| `stock-audit/[id]/page.tsx:450` | drop `!isAssignee` |
| **new** `api/approvals/error-rate/route.ts` (`reports.view`) | per approver: approvals, errors by type, rate — applying `approval-rules` over stored events (corrections matched to the latest `APPROVED` inbound/transfer event for the same product + warehouse within `windowDays`) |
| **new** `settings/approvals/page.tsx` (+ Settings index card) | edit the rule (`settings.edit`) and show the error-rate table |

### 3.6a Wave 1 — Part I: category tree (R43, P12, P13)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| **new** `src/lib/categories/tree.ts` | `categorySubtreeIds(db, id)` (recursive CTE, cycle-safe) and `buildCategoryTree(rows)`; used by `api/products` (F), rule matching (H) and pickers |
| **new** `src/components/category-tree-select.tsx` | searchable picker showing parents with children indented; optional "parent only" mode for the rule form's first select and "children of X" mode for the second |
| `api/categories/zoho-import/route.ts` | **P12**: second pass sets `parentId` from Zoho `parent_category_id` → our row with that `zohoCategoryId`; existing rows get their parent on re-import; a parent that would create a cycle is skipped with `log.warn`; the "deliberately flat" comment (:25-27) is replaced with this decision |
| `src/lib/integrations/inventory.ts` + `endpoints.ts` | **R47**: `listItems(page)` / `listAllItems()` over Zoho `/items` (200 per page; `category_id` is on each item, `inventory.ts:17`) registered in the endpoint registry |
| `api/categories/zoho-import/route.ts` (continued) | **R47**: after categories, re-link products — every product with a `zohoItemId` gets `categoryId` = our row whose `zohoCategoryId` = the item's `category_id` (null when Zoho has none); chunked updates; summary `{categoriesCreated, parentsSet, productsRelinked, productsWithoutCategory}` |
| **new** `scripts/db/wipe-categories.mjs` + `package.json` `db:wipe:categories` | **P12a (b)** — copies `scripts/db/wipe-deliveries.mjs` safety exactly: prints host, database and counts; deletes only after the database name is typed (or `--yes <name>`); refuses without a `db:snapshot` of that database from the last 60 minutes; **one transaction**. Order: `Product.categoryId → null`, `InboundShipment.categoryId → null` (it is `Restrict`), delete `HomeBinRule` rows with a category, `Category.parentId → null`, delete all `Category` rows. Keeps products, stock, units, bins and brand-only rules. Prints what the owner must do next: run **Fetch from Zoho** on `/categories`, then re-create category home-bin rules |
| `api/categories/zoho-preview/route.ts` | preview shows the Zoho parent name per row |
| `(dashboard)/categories/page.tsx` | tree view (expand/collapse, children indented); **parent picker** on create and edit (sends `parentId`); back link → `/stock` (Q27) |

### 3.6b Wave 2 — Part H: bins — rules, existing stock, unit codes, non-assemblable (R38–R42, P6–P11, P13)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `api/bins/home-rules/route.ts` | POST accepts `categoryId` + `subcategoryId?`; **refuses** when the category has active children and no subcategory is given (P13); stores the subcategory as `categoryId`; response includes the category path |
| **new** `src/lib/bins/rule-match.ts` | one matcher for put-away, inward (P4) **and** apply: precedence product > brand + category > category > brand, **exact category** (rules always name a leaf, P13) |
| `api/inbound/[id]/putaway/route.ts` GET | uses `rule-match.ts` (replaces the inline chain :49-113) |
| `api/inbound/[id]/route.ts` receive (after B) | **P4 (2)**: when the receiver picked no bin, units go into the bin `rule-match.ts` returns for that warehouse (status `PUT_AWAY`, `BinMovementLog`, `syncBinStock`); a hand-picked bin wins |
| **new** `api/bins/home-rules/[id]/apply/route.ts` | **R40, P10 (b)** — `bins.edit`. `GET` = dry run: per product, every matching unit in the rule's warehouse that is not already in the rule's bin (no bin, or another bin), plus units **skipped** by P6 (non-assemblable into an assemblable bin). `POST` moves all of them in one transaction, one `BinMovementLog` per unit, sets `Product.binId` to the rule's bin, `syncBinStock` for every bin touched |
| **new** `api/bins/generate-unit-codes/route.ts` | **R41, R46, P8** — `bins.edit`. Scope: warehouse (required), optional bin. `GET` = dry run: per product per warehouse `StockLevel.quantity − live units`, and the bin each would go to (`BinStock` row, else `Product.binId` in that warehouse, else no bin). `POST` creates one unit per item via `createUnits` — **unassembled**, stamped non-assemblable when the bin is (P6); no condition choice — then `syncBinStock`, and returns the new unit ids for the label sheet |
| **new** `src/components/units/unit-label-sheet.tsx` + `api/units/labels/route.ts` (`barcode.create`) | **R46**: printable label sheet for a list of unit ids — per label a **Code 128 barcode of the unit code** (existing `generateBarcodePng`, `src/lib/barcode.ts`), the code in large text (`U-000086`), product name and SKU; browser print like `stock/[id]/barcode/page.tsx:73-116`. Opened with the new codes right after **Generate unit codes**, and reprintable per bin, per inbound shipment and per unit |
| `bins/page.tsx` rules modal (after F moved `/bins` into a component) | Category + **Subcategory — required when the chosen category has subcategories, hidden when it has none** (R39, P13) + Brand + Bin; on save, a panel **"Apply to existing stock"** shows the dry run (moving N · from which bins · skipped M) and a Confirm (P10 (b)) |
| bins directory (same component) | **Non-assemblable** checkbox on the **create bin** form only; shown read-only on edit (R42, P6, P6a); a **Generate unit codes** button per warehouse and per bin with the dry-run summary, then the label sheet (R41, R46) |
| `api/bins/route.ts`, `api/bins/[id]/route.ts` | POST accepts `nonAssemblable`; PATCH refuses to change it (P6a) |
| **new** `api/units/[id]/assemblable/route.ts` | P6b correction: POST `{reason}` — `bins.edit`; clears `InventoryUnit.nonAssemblable` on one unit; `logActivity`; a button on the bin's unit list |
| `api/bins/move/route.ts`, `api/bins/assign/route.ts`, `api/inbound/[id]/putaway/route.ts` POST | after changing unit `binId`, call `syncBinStock` for the bins touched (P11) instead of the separate `BinStock` increments |

The R38 bin-level reduction itself needs no code in the delivery routes: B's `sellUnits` calls
`syncBinStock` for the bins the sold units were in.

### 3.7 Wave 3 — Part G: dashboard (R35–R37, Q29, Q30)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| **new** `api/dashboard/overview/route.ts` (`requireAuth`) | builds only the sections the caller's grants allow, each checked with `userCan` server-side: **Money** (`accounts.view`: payables, receivables, overdue — reuse `accounts/summary` logic; stock value — `stock.view`); **Stuck** (approvals waiting > `approvals` h per activity the user can approve; inbound pending > `inbound` h (`inbound.view`); holds > `holds` h (`assembly.approve`); short outwards (`deliveries.view`)); **In progress** (★ builds, builds in progress, transfers `IN_TRANSIT`, audits `IN_PROGRESS`); **Done today** (delivered, builds completed, transfers received, inbound received); **Stock by condition** (`stock.view`: unassembled, assembled, oldest unassembled days) |
| `(dashboard)/page.tsx` | one layout rendering the returned sections; the six variants and `pickDashboard` removed; `MyStockAudits` / `MyAssemblyTasks` stay above |
| `settings/approvals/page.tsx` | add the stuck-hours editor (`settings.edit`) |

### 3.8 Wave 3 — Part Q: notification action buttons (R24, Q19)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/notify/types.ts`, `push.ts` `buildMessage` | optional `actions[{action,title}]` → `webpush.notification.actions` and `data.actions` |
| `public/sw.js` | pass `actions` to `showNotification`; on click `event.action === "approve"` → `fetch POST /api/approvals/quick` (same-origin cookie) then show a result notification; `"reject"`/`"open"`/body → open `data.link` |
| **new** `api/approvals/quick/route.ts` | `{activity, recordId, action:"approve"}` → dispatches to the inbound / transfer / delivery approve functions (each re-checks its `approve` grant); stock audit is **Open only** (its approval needs the apply choice) |
| approval notifications from C and D | pass `actions: approve, reject, open` |

### 3.9 Phases, agents and file ownership

| Wave | Agent | Owns | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | S | `prisma/schema.prisma`, the migration, `prisma/rbac-catalog.ts`, `src/lib/notify/events.ts`, `src/lib/approvals/events.ts`, `src/lib/settings/{approval-rules,stuck-hours}.ts` | — |
| 0 | schema-reviewer | read-only review of the migration | S |
| 1 | B | `src/lib/units/*`, `src/lib/stock-location.ts`, inbound route, inventory inwards/outwards/cleanup, transfer dispatch/receive, deliveries `[id]` + batch (sale only), stock-counts apply/items/zero-uncounted, stock-audit counting page, stock-reset/warehouse + its UI | S |
| 1 | E | `src/app/(dashboard)/assembly/**`, `src/app/api/assembly/**`, `scanner/page.tsx`, `src/components/scanner/*`, vendor-issue create page | S |
| 1 | F | sidebar renderers, `src/stores/permissions.ts`, module API, `stock/**` pages, `api/products`, `api/stock/condition`, `stores/page.tsx`, `bins/page.tsx` (extraction only), `settings/page.tsx` | S; uses I's tree helper — F imports `src/lib/categories/tree.ts` and `category-tree-select.tsx` once I has written them (I writes those two files **first**) |
| 1 | I | `src/lib/categories/tree.ts`, `src/components/category-tree-select.tsx`, `api/categories/**`, `(dashboard)/categories/page.tsx`, `src/lib/integrations/{inventory,endpoints}.ts` (items listing), `scripts/db/wipe-categories.mjs`, `package.json` script | S |
| 2 | C | `src/lib/deliveries/*`, `api/deliveries/**` (incl. `find-stock`), `src/lib/integrations/google-contacts.ts`, `api/integrations/google-contacts/**`, `api/customers/google-sync`, `customers/page.tsx`, the Google card on `settings/integrations/page.tsx`, `api/public/delivery/**`, `deliveries/**` screens, `src/lib/approvals/actions/delivery.ts` | B |
| 2 | D | `src/lib/transfers/*`, `api/transfer-orders/**`, `transfers/**`, `api/inbound/[id]/{approve,reject,resubmit}`, inbound create + DELETE event, `inbound/[id]/page.tsx`, `api/stock-counts/[id]/route.ts` (after B), `stock-audit/[id]/page.tsx:450`, `api/approvals/error-rate`, `api/approvals/pending`, `(dashboard)/approvals/**`, `settings/approvals/**`, `src/lib/approvals/actions/{inbound,transfer}.ts` | B |
| 2 | H | `api/bins/**` (home-rules, apply, generate-unit-codes, move, assign, bins CRUD), `src/lib/bins/*`, `api/inbound/[id]/putaway/route.ts`, the bins component F extracted | B, F, I |
| 3 | G | `(dashboard)/page.tsx`, `api/dashboard/overview`, stuck-hours editor | C, D, H |
| 3 | Q | `src/lib/notify/{types,push}.ts`, `public/sw.js`, `api/approvals/quick` | C, D |

Every agent reads its board-of-agents docs before writing (below), follows CLAUDE.md logging
rules, and reports files changed + checks run. After each wave: `npx tsc --noEmit`, eslint on the
wave's files, then one commit on the branch.

### 3.9a Google Contacts — one-time setup the owner does (P14a)

1. **console.cloud.google.com** → create a project, e.g. *BCH Management*.
2. **APIs & Services → Library** → enable **People API**.
3. **OAuth consent screen** → User type **External** (or **Internal** if the shop account is Google
   Workspace) → app name, support email → scope **`.../auth/contacts`** → add the shop Gmail as a
   **test user**. Then **Publish app** ("In production"): while it stays in *Testing*, Google expires
   the refresh token after **7 days** and the sync stops. A personal-use app with a sensitive scope
   can be published without verification; the shop account will see an "unverified app" warning
   once, at connect.
4. **Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application** → Authorised redirect
   URIs: `http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/google-contacts/callback` and the deployed
   `https://<app domain>/api/integrations/google-contacts/callback`.
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** → the app's **Settings › Integrations › Google
   Contacts** → paste → **Connect Google** → sign in as the shop account → Allow.
6. On each staff phone that should see customers: add the shop Google account and turn on
   **Contacts** sync for it.

### 3.10 RBAC

- New grant: `delivery_priority.edit` (catalog, R19). Everything else reuses existing grants —
  see requirements doc §6. No role or person name in code; every new route calls `requireFeature`
  (or `userCan` per section for the dashboard); buttons are cosmetic only.
- The public routes (`/fill/[token]`, `api/public/*`) get the notification call but **no**
  permission check.

### 3.11 Logging

Every new route and lib: `createLogger` scope per module (`units:pick`, `deliveries:priority`,
`approvals:transfer`, `dashboard:overview`, …). `log.info` on each business event (units sold /
moved / retired with counts and ids; star set/cleared with deliveryId; approval
requested/approved/returned with activity + recordId); `log.warn` on refusals (short floor,
unapproved dispatch) and swallowed notification failures; `log.error` before every rethrow. No
payload dumps, no tokens.

### 3.12 Board of agents — to check during the build

| Agent doc | Why it applies |
|---|---|
| `docs/agents/inventory-consultant.md` | unit ↔ stock sync, reset, audit split |
| `docs/agents/warehouse-consultant.md` | godown → floor transfer, dispatch, bins tab |
| `docs/agents/database-architect.md` | the migration, indexes, `ApprovalEvent` |
| `docs/agents/backend-engineer.md` | new routes, zod, status transitions |
| `docs/agents/frontend-engineer.md` | assembly split, one-tap hold, sidebar, dashboard |
| `docs/agents/integration-architect.md` | FCM actions, service worker |

## 4. Verification

Owner runs `npm run build` (21–45 min, memory) after Wave 3; Claude runs `npx tsc --noEmit` and
eslint per wave. Local database `bch_local` only.

1. **Units in sync (§4.8 of the requirements doc):** receive 10 → transfer 6 godown→floor (units
   move, 3 assembled + 3 oldest) → deliver 5 (5 SOLD) → audit godown with 1 missing (1 LOST).
   `/stock/condition` and Awaiting show 3 + 1; `/stock` counts match.
2. **Reset + unit audit:** reset BCH Godown → its units `RESET`, counts 0; audit with assembled 4 /
   unassembled 8 → approve → 12 units, 4 assembled.
3. **Outward guard:** schedule an outward with floor 0 / godown 2 → accepted, warning names the
   godown, a `transfers.create` holder gets a push; Out for delivery → refused with the same text;
   walk-out → refused + push.
4. **★:** star it → 2 godown units reserved, unassembled ones top of Awaiting with the day; swap
   one; unstar → released; a build in progress continues.
5. **Outbound approval:** Out for delivery disabled until approved; reject → returned banner →
   request again → approve → dispatch works; walk-out needs none; batch refuses unapproved ids.
6. **Transfers / inbound:** reject with note → RETURNED → edit → resubmit → approve; inbound reject →
   resubmit → approve → receive; creator holding approve approves own; audit assignee approves own.
7. **Error rate:** approve an inbound, correct that product in an audit within 7 days → one error
   for that approver; change `windowDays` to 1 → recalculated.
8. **Assembly:** each `?tab=` loads and survives refresh; mechanic on `?tab=awaiting` lands on
   `mine`; hold = one tap; reload keeps the frozen time; supervisor note; Raise vendor issue
   pre-filled; select all N matching → bulk assign; filters and sorts; Labels tab = scanner.
9. **Sidebar:** Operations = Build line assembly, Stock management (expand only: Stock & inventory,
   divider, 1–4); Sales; POS in Accounts; Admin › Settings › Store management with three tabs;
   no Categories/Brands/Barcode/Bins items; chips on `/stock`. After `npm run db:seed:rbac`.
10. **Dashboard:** admin sees every row; a mechanic role sees only build cards; change stuck hours
    → Stuck counts change.
11. **Push actions:** Android Chrome / desktop — Approve on the notification approves; iPhone opens.
12. **Bin-level stock (R38):** sell a unit from `FLOOR-R3` → `FLOOR-R3`'s bin stock drops by one;
    move a unit between bins → both bins' counts follow.
13. **Rules on existing stock (R39, R40):** rule Hero · Bicycles › 29-inch · `GODOWN-A2` → dry run lists
    all 20 matching items (12 unbinned, 8 from `GODOWN-A5`) → confirm → all 20 moved, movement log
    written, both bins' counts follow.
14. **Unit codes for existing stock (R41):** a godown with `StockLevel` 12 and 0 units → dry run says
    12 → generate → 12 unassembled `U-` codes, each different, in the bin; labels print one per item; built floor cycles are then set to assembled by a unit-level audit.
15. **Non-assemblable (R42):** mark `GODOWN-S07` non-assemblable → its units leave Awaiting and appear
    on `/assembly?tab=no-assembly`; `/stock` "No assembly" chip; condition page third column.
16. **Categories (R43, R47):** import from Zoho → children sit under their Zoho parent on `/categories`;
    each product's category equals its Zoho item's category; `/stock` filter on a parent shows the
    children's products too, on a child only its own.
17. **Save to phone (R44):** connect the shop Google account in Settings › Integrations → Save Customer on an
    outward (saved in the app only) → `/customers` shows it "not synced" → tick it → Sync to Google → it
    appears in Google Contacts (group "BCH Customers") and on a phone signed into that account; syncing
    the same phone again reports "already in Google"; disconnect Google → Sync shows failed with reason.
18. **Find stock (R45):** outward short on BCH Floor → Find stock lists BCH Godown 2, Whitefield Floor 1 → pick BCH Godown → a `GODOWN_TO_FLOOR` transfer `PENDING` with no document, linked to the outward; an approver sees it under **Requests** and approves → dispatch refused until a challan is attached → attach, dispatch (godown bin and units go down) → receive (floor, bin, units go up) → the outward's stock is held automatically.

## 5. Out of scope, deliberately

- Reassigning or cancelling a build (Q39).
- A delivery time (Q32/Q40) and any change to the slot calendar.
- An assembled-only outward check (Q10).
- `stock-counts/[id]` DELETE writing `currentStock` without `StockLevel` (§2.1) — known gap, raise
  separately.
- The old bin-prefix `api/stock-reset`.
- Mechanic picker listing every active user (requirements doc defect 11).
- Everything in the requirements doc §8.
- Pushing categories (or parents) to Zoho (P12).
- A native Android app for contacts (P14 (c)).
