//
// THIS IS NOT SAMPLE DATA, and the distinction matters — prisma/seed.ts says in its header
// that no sample data is seeded. Stores and warehouses are INFRASTRUCTURE: the stock system
// cannot function with zero warehouses any more than it can with zero roles, because after
// Phase 4 of the store-hierarchy plan every StockLevel row points at a warehouse and has
// nowhere to point until one exists. Categories and brands are sample data; these are not.
//
// SAFE TO RE-RUN. Idempotent on `code`, which is why `code` reuses the old StockLocation
// enum strings ("BCH_WAREHOUSE", "BCH_STORE", ...) — the Phase 4 backfill becomes a plain
// lookup by the value already sitting in the column, rather than a mapping table.
//
// The shape below is the STARTING shape, not the permanent one. Two sites, two locations
// each: the shop FLOOR and the GODOWN (plan 0909-stock-store-and-warehouse-scoping, D1).
// Adding another location under a store is an INSERT through /stores with no migration and
// no redeploy — that is the whole reason these are rows instead of an enum.
// See docs/implementation/pending/store-hierarchy-and-team-plan.md §2.1.
//
// The floor's sortOrder (5) is BELOW the godown's (10) on purpose: every picker lists the
// floor first, and that is also the order outbound drains a store (D4).
