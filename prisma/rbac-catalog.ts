  // ── Store Management ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // A parent plus two children, the second module tree in this catalog after Staff LMS.
  //
  // `store_management` is a ROOT module and must stay one: `stores` and `warehouses` are its
  // children, and nesting the parent under `settings` would make them GRANDCHILDREN, which
  // seed-rbac.ts:48 rejects outright — the sidebar walks exactly two levels, so a grandchild
  // would exist in the database and render nowhere.
  //
  // The parent is a grouping construct and its own `view` grant does almost nothing:
  // app-sidebar.tsx builds a placeholder parent from a child's carried parent data, so the
  // heading appears whenever EITHER child is granted. The real gates are stores.* and
  // warehouses.*. Do not give it CRUD expecting it to gate anything.
  //
  // Two modules rather than one, decided 30 Aug 2026: "open a new store" and "add a warehouse
  // to an existing site" are different decisions, and a warehouse supervisor can reasonably
  // hold the second without the first.
  //
  // Only the FIRST child has a page. `warehouses` is permission-only (route: null, 9 Sep
  // 2026): warehouses are created and edited inside /stores, and the module exists to hold
  // the create/edit/delete grants that gate /api/warehouses. The heading therefore survives
  // on `stores` alone — app-sidebar.tsx keeps a parent while at least one child has a route,
  // so if `stores` were ever nulled too the whole Store Management heading would vanish.
