// ─── Push ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This is the ONLY push handler. The Firebase SDK on the page is handed THIS registration
// (src/components/enable-push-button.tsx passes `serviceWorkerRegistration`), so it never
// installs its own firebase-messaging-sw.js and no second worker can show the same
// notification twice. It also means the message arrives raw: FCM v1 webpush delivers
//   { notification: { title, body, icon }, data: { ...string values }, fcmOptions: { link } }
// and nothing has unpacked it for us.
//
// Every push is shown, focused tab or not. Firebase's own worker would hand a foreground
// message to the page instead, but that hand-off is private to its worker (the page-side
// onMessage() ignores anything without its `isFirebaseMessaging` flag), and on Android
// Chrome a page cannot construct a Notification anyway — it has to come back through this
// registration. For an ops app a notification while the tab is open is the wanted behaviour.
//
// Sound (plan 2309, Q11 b): when a window of the app is FOCUSED, the notification is shown
// `silent` and the page plays its own chime (src/stores/inbox.ts). In every other case —
// background tab, minimised, app closed — the device's own notification sound plays. Either
// way exactly one sound, never two.
//
// Badge (plan 2309, Part D): `data.unread` is the recipient's inbox count, written by notify().
// setAppBadge puts it on the installed app's icon where the platform supports it (Windows/macOS
// installed PWA, iOS 16.4+ Home Screen app). Android ignores it and draws its own dot.
//
// No logger here: a service worker cannot import src/lib/logger.ts. console.error in the
// catch blocks is the one thing that is allowed to speak.

// ─── Action buttons (plan 1709 §3.8, R24, Q19) ────────────────────────────────

// An approval notification carries two buttons: "Approve" (action id `approve`) and "Open"
// (action id `reject`, named for the plan's vocabulary — see src/lib/approvals/notify-actions.ts
// for why the label is not "Reject"). Everything else — the body tap included — opens data.link.
//
// The buttons arrive one of two ways and we accept either. FCM merges `webpush.notification`
// into the delivered payload's `notification`, so `notification.actions` is normally already
// there; `data.actions` is the same list as a JSON string, sent because every FCM data value
// must be a string and because that merge is Google's behaviour rather than our contract.
//
// A browser with no action support (iOS Safari) drops the whole thing silently: showNotification
// ignores an `actions` option it does not know, no button is drawn, and the body tap still opens
// the record. That is why the buttons are a shortcut and never the only route.
